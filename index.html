Whitewash in 1965, the first book criticizing the conclusion of the Warren Commission. Since then, he has written and published seven books on President Kennedy's assassination. Case Open is a book Mr. Weisberg felt compelled to write. He felt a need and determination to set the record straight.<br>In proving that Gerald Posner, in Case Closed, has proven nothing, Mr. Weisberg has proven that President Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy.<br>In analyzing Case Closed, he demonstrates that Gerald Posner has distorted evidence, suppressed evidence, omitted evidence, developed no new evidence, omitted sources, misappropriated the research of others and misled the reader into believing that he had sponsored new scientific computer enhancements.<br>At best, Gerald Posner has provided a case for the prosecution. Now it is time to present the case for Case Open.<br>Let the American public decide who has presented the stronger case: Gerald Posner or Harold Weisberg.</p><p>Also called <i> Case Open : The Ommissions, Distortions and Falsifications of Case Closed</i></p><h2>The Efficient Golfer: Using Videotape, Measurement and Good Sense To Improve Your Swing and Putting Mechanics</h2><p>The Efficient Golfer is the first golf book to show readers how to videotape, measure and analyze their swing and putting mechanics. It is intended for single-digit or better players who want to increase the precision of their ballstriking. All that is needed to analyze your swing is this book, a camcorder with a high-speed shutter and frame-by-frame playback, a tripod, a large screen TV, a protractor, and an erasable marker. Once you have read through the book, the initial analysis of your swing and putting mechanics will take about an hour. You will be able to measure your Range (how far you turn away from the ball), Sequence, Speed, Separation and Alignment. By measuring your mechanics, you will be able to uncover problems in your swing that are not visible by just watching a videotape. Once you have uncover any swing problems, the book makes recommendations for fixes and improvements. The book also has chapters on the yips and low back pain, as well as directions for measuring your flexibility for golf. Professional golfers who have used this system have won the US Open, improved their tour ranking in putting average from #113 to #1, increased their longest drive from 295 to 400, and quadrupled their tour income. The book is intended only for personal use and not for commercial or education applications.</p><p>Robert Anthony Prichard has been improving athletic performance for 37 years by improving efficiency and flexibility in athletes.

Blaylock, P.C. Hodgell, Robert Westall, Michael de Larrabeiti, and Robin McKinley</p><p><p>Gr 7 Up An exciting anthology of fantasy stories, all set in particularly vivid imaginary places and specially commissioned for this volume. The stories show variety and balance in their length, subject matter and style, featuring both male and female protagonists, some young and some not so young. James P. Blaylock describes a marvelously strange California of giant crabs and artificial dragons in his enchanting mood piece ``Paper Dragons,'' while Robert Westall's charming tale of a lost underground town preserved in the tunnels of a salt mine (``The Big Rock Candy Mountain'') contrasts with the poetic mysticism of Patricia A. McKillip's ``The Old Woman and the Storm.'' Although P. C. Hodgell's ``Stranger Blood'' begins with a confusing presentation of background and family histories, complicated by the fact that every other name seems to begin with K, it rapidly becomes a terrific tale of blood, skulls and magic. Also beguiling are the dry wit of Peter Dickinson's pseudo-historical document ``Flight'' and the extremely appealing heroine in the editor's ``The Stone Fey.'' Well-wrought stories by Jane Yolen, Michael de Larrabeiti and Joan D. Vinge round out this superlative collection. Lyle Blake Smythers, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.</p><p>Copyright 1986 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>This fantasy anthology, boasting some of the best writers in the genre today, will be a disappointment to all but the most easily pleased. Each story is linked by its firm placement in its imaginary setting, which is supposed to evoke in readers both wonder and familiarity. Unfortunately, these stories evoke only tedium and confusion, the major exception being McKinley's own entry, "The Stone Fey," a beautifully written love story set in Damar. While stories from James Blaylock, Patricia McKillip, Robert Westall and P. C. Hodgell are merely slight, the biggest disappointments are the stories from Peter Dickenson, whose "Flight" is more of a writer's notebook than a story; Jane Yolen, with a slim retelling of the forging of Excalibur; and Joan D. Vinge's brief version of the Tam Lin legend. Given the lack of quality from "name" writers, it's too bad McKinley didn't anthologize her own work. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Heart Like His: The Shaping of Character in the Choices of Life</h2><p>The author takes a careful look at the choices David made and through them shows how you can radiate faith, live on the keen edge of hope, and develop a heart like God&#39;s - even in desperate circumstances.</p><p></p><h2>Jack: Secret Circles (Repairman Jack)</h2><p><p>When his five-year-old neighbor goes missing, Jack can&#x2019;t help feeling responsible. He should have taken Cody home when he found him riding his bicycle near the Pine Barrens. And then a lost man wanders out of the woods after being chased all night by...something.&nbsp;Jack knows, better than anyone, that the Barrens are dangerous&#x2014;a true wilderness filled with people, creatures, and objects lost from sight and memory. Like the ancient, fifteen-foot-tall stone pyramid he, Weezy, and Eddie discover.&nbsp;Jack thinks it might have been a cage of some sort, but for what kind of animal, he can&#x2019;t say.&nbsp;Eddie jokes that it could have been used for the Jersey Devil. Jack doesn't believe in that old folk tale, but <i>something</i> is roaming the Pines.&nbsp;Could it have Cody?&nbsp;And what about the strange circus that set up outside town?&nbsp;Could they be involved? So many possibilities, so little time...</p></p><p>F.

Even though the sky was overcast now, the air felt dry. He hoped it would last. He was sick to death of rain. People were saying this could turn out to be the rainiest September on record and&#x2014;</p><p>"Hey!" he shouted as he almost collided with a little kid scooting by on a red bike. "Cody!"</p><p>The kid braked and almost fell off his bike.</p><p>"Jack! Jack! I can do it!"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Look! No training wheels!"</p><p>Cody Bockman was five and lived two doors down from Jack. His long hair was a blond tangle and his blue eyes sparkled with excitement. Cute kid, but a little wild man. Jack liked him except when he attached himself and followed him around like a dog. Somehow he always chose times when Jack felt like being alone.</p><p>"That&#x2019;s cool, Code." Jack looked around. Not an adult in sight. "Your folks know you&#x2019;re out here?"</p><p>"No, but it&#x2019;s okay."</p><p>"Yeah? You mean, if I go back and ask your mom and dad if it&#x2019;s all right for you to be cruising the streets, they&#x2019;ll say it&#x2019;s fine with them?"</p><p>Cody looked down. "Well . . ."</p><p>Jack put on a stern look. "You gonna go or am I gonna have to take you back?"</p><p>"I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019;!"</p><p>He turned his bike around and pedaled a wobbly path back toward Jefferson. Jack watched him a little, then continued on to the Connells&#x2019;.</p><p>Weezy&#x2019;s brother Eddie had asked him over to play Berzerk, the new game his father had bought him for his Atari 5200. The game was simple and so fun when you could trick the robots into walking into walls or shooting each other, but so nerve- racking when that deadly smiley face came bouncing through.</p><p>But no video games today. He&#x2019;d played enough during the rains. This morning he was going to drag Eddie off the couch and into the sunlight. No easy task, considering Eddie&#x2019;s weight and resistance to any activity that involved moving more than his thumbs.</p><p>As Jack glided past the unlidded garbage cans at the curb&#x2014; Wednesday and Saturday were garbage days in Johnson&#x2014; he noticed a couple of familiar items from Weezy&#x2019;s room in the nearer container. He stopped for a closer look and saw copies of Fortean Times and Fate. Weezy treasured those weird paranormal magazines. Why was she throwing them out?</p><p>Maybe she was in a cleaning mood. She had all sorts of moods lately. Spin the dial and see who appeared.</p><p>Or maybe she didn&#x2019;t know. Her parents were always on her case for not being like other fifteen- year- old girls. Had they simply gone in and started tossing stuff? That wasn&#x2019;t right.</p><p>He spotted a half- folded photo, an aerial shot of the Pinelands, the million acres of woods beyond the town&#x2019;s eastern edge. He recognized the scene: an excavation of the mound where just last month he and Weezy had found a corpse and a mysterious little pyramid.</p><p>The sight of it released a flood of memories . . . most of them bad. He&#x2019;d blocked them out, but now they were back. The dead man was not simply dead, he&#x2019;d been murdered&#x2014; ritually murdered&#x2014; and his discovery had triggered other deaths, all seemingly of natural causes, but all weirdly connected. Then Jack had learned the cause, and it hadn&#x2019;t been natural at all. But he couldn&#x2019;t talk about it because he had no proof and everyone&#x2014; even Weezy&#x2014; would think he was crazy.</p><p>And the pyramid . . . shiny, black, embossed with strange glyphs . . . Weezy had fallen in love with it, memorizing every detail of the symbols on its sides and the weird grid inside the box that had held it. It had turned out to be older that it seemed&#x2014; much older than anything man- made should be.</p><p>Then it had disappeared.</p><p>And Weezy hadn&#x2019;t been quite the same since. Jack had felt the loss too&#x2014; such a neat artifact&#x2014; but not like Weezy. She&#x2019;d taken it like the loss of her best friend. But more than that, she was convinced it had been stolen and was sure she knew the culprit . . . all without a shred of proof.</p><p>So he couldn&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;d throw away this photo.</p><p>He snagged it from the can and stuck it in his back pocket as he hopped up the front steps and knocked on the door.</p><p>"Door&#x2019;s open," he heard a man&#x2019;s voice call from inside.</p><p>As Jack stepped in, Mr. Connell poked his crew- cut head around a corner and grinned. "Eddie said you&#x2019;d be coming. He&#x2019;s in the family room."</p><p>"Is Weezy here?"</p><p>"Yeah. Hey, Weez!"</p><p>"What?" Her voice floated from upstairs.</p><p>"Jack&#x2019;s here!"</p><p>Weezy appeared at the top of the stairway in her customary black jeans and a black T-shirt. She had dark eyes and pale skin. She&#x2019;d gone a little heavier than usual on the eyeliner today. She held a book in her right hand, her index finger poked between two pages. She&#x2019;d been letting her dark hair grow and today she&#x2019;d parted it in the middle and braided it into a pair of pigtails.</p><p>"Hey, Jack. Come on up."</p><p>"Going for the Wednesday Addams look?" he said as he took the steps two at a time.</p><p>"Well, it&#x2019;s the weekend and I&#x2019;m full of woe."</p><p>He followed her into her room, christened the "Bat Cave" by her brother. With all the shades drawn, a dark purple bedspread, gargoyles peering down from her bookshelves, and a creepy Bauhaus poster on the wall, it lived up to the name.</p><p>"About anything in particular?"</p><p>"The usual&#x2014; everything." She belly- flopped onto the bed and opened her book.</p><p>"What&#x2019;s so interesting?"</p><p>"Just got it from the library. All about pre- Sumerian civilizations. What&#x2019;s up?"</p><p>Jack pulled the photo from his pocket and held it up. "I found this in your garbage can."</p><p>She glanced up with a smile. "Are you Dumpster diving now?" Then her gaze fixed on the wrinkled photo. "Isn&#x2019;t that . . . ?"</p><p>"Yeah. Never thought you&#x2019;d toss it out."</p><p>She was up in a flash grabbing it from him.</p><p>"I didn&#x2019;t." Her expression turned furious. "They have no right!"</p><p>As she started for her door Jack blocked her way. She had a wild look in her eyes. Jack had seen that look a few times before when she&#x2019;d lost it, and she seemed ready to lose it now.</p><p>"Easy, Weezy. Could you maybe wait on this? You&#x2019;re going to put me smack- dab in the middle of the fight."</p><p>For a second he thought she might hit him. He didn&#x2019;t know what he&#x2019;d do if she tried. He was relieved when the look faded.</p><p>"Because you found it?"</p><p>He nodded. He didn&#x2019;t want to become a player in the ongoing tug-of-war between Weezy and her parents&#x2014; mostly her father&#x2014; who wanted her to be what they called "a normal girl" and what she called "a bow head."</p><p>"You know," she said, her voice thickening as she stalked about her room, "if they&#x2019;re so unhappy with me, why don&#x2019;t they just send me off to boarding school or something so they don&#x2019;t have to look at me?"</p><p>Jack didn&#x2019;t like that idea one bit. Who would he hang with? He tried to lighten the moment by clutching his hands over his heart and giving her his best approximation of a lost- puppy look.</p><p>"But- but- but wouldn&#x2019;t you miss meeee?"</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t work. She was off to the races. She&#x2019;d always been hard to stop once she got rolling, but almost impossible since the disappearance of the pyramid. She&#x2019;d gotten a little scary lately.</p><p>"I&#x2019;m going to be fifteen next week! I&#x2019;ve got a brain, why don&#x2019;t they want me to use it? They have no right to throw out my stuff!" She stopped her pacing. "Maybe I should pull a Marcie Kurek! That&#x2019;d show &#x2019;em!"</p><p>Marcie Kurek was a runaway who&#x2019;d been a soph at the high school last year. She lived in Shamong. One night she said she was going out to visit a friend and never showed up. No one had seen her since.</p><p>Weezy turned and threw the photo on the floor.</p><p>Jack knew she tended to leave her stuff all over the house, a perfect invitation for her folks to dump the things they didn&#x2019;t approve of, especially anything that referred to what she called the Secret History of the World.</p><p>The Secret History was her passion&#x2014; her conviction that accepted history was a collection of lies carefully constructed and arranged to hide what was really going on in the world, and conceal the hidden agenda and identities of those pulling the strings. Ancient secret societies manipulating events throughout the ages . . .</p><p>People&#x2014;especially her family&#x2014; tended to roll their eyes once she got started on it. Jack too, though not as quickly as he used to. He&#x2019;d seen and heard things last month that he couldn&#x2019;t explain . . . he didn&#x2019;t know if they fit into Weezy&#x2019;s Secret History, didn&#x2019;t know if they fit anywhere, or if they were even real.</p><p>Weezy was convinced that the pyramid they&#x2019;d found was connected to the Secret History. And maybe it was . . . this was a picture of the mound where they&#x2019;d found the body and the artifact, or rather what was left after those strange government men had dug it up in the night.</p><p>He glanced at it now on the floor and was once again struck by the strange outline. As he looked he noticed something to the right of the mound . . .</p><p>He picked it up for a closer look . . . a dark object or structure in a small clearing. He&#x2019;d never noticed it before. But then again, the photo had been in Weezy&#x2019;s possession all this time, so he&#x2019;d never had much chance to study it.</p><p>"Hey, Weez. Where&#x2019;s your magnifying glass? Or did your folks throw that away too?"</p><p>"Not funny."</p><p>She plucked a magnifier with a two- inch lens from a shelf above her desk and handed it to him. Jack poised it over the area in question and felt a tingle of excitement across his neck as it grew larger and came into focus.</p><p>"Oh, man, you&#x2019;ve got to see this." He passed the lens and photo to her, then tapped the spot. "Right there."</p><p>He watched her brow furrow as she moved the lens up and down and around.</p><p>"Hmmph. Never noticed." She glanced up. "Could be just a big rock."</p><p>"Yeah? Take another look. Count the sides."</p><p>He watched her eyes narrow to a squint as she complied, then widen. She wore an entirely different expression when she looked up this time.</p><p>"Six."</p><p>"Yeah. Just like our pyramid."</p><p>A light sparked in her eyes. "Actually it had seven if you count the base. But this is bigger. Much bigger." She frowned. "Too big for them to steal."</p><p>Jack knew who "them" were but didn&#x2019;t want her to get started on that now.</p><p>"You got that right. Want to take a look?"</p><p>"You kidding? Of course I&#x2014;"</p><p>"There you are!"</p><p>Jack turned and saw Weezy&#x2019;s portly brother standing in the doorway, twisting a Rubik&#x2019;s Cube. He had short, sandy hair and a pudgy body, and his striped rugby shirt gave him a definite Pugsley look. Jack was tempted to remark on the Addams Family theme here in the Connell house, but held his tongue. Eddie wouldn&#x2019;t take kindly to the Pugsley comparison.</p><p>But if Cousin Itt showed up . . .</p><p>"Hey Eddie. I was just&#x2014;"</p><p>"No Berzerk today, man," Eddie said, looking miffed. "My dad&#x2019;s booting me out of the house. Wants me to &#x2018;enjoy the outdoors.&#x2019; Can you believe it?" He shook his head sadly. "Bo-racious."</p><p>Eddie was not a fan of the outdoors, unless it meant sitting in the shade with a copy of Uncanny X-Men.</p><p>Jack pointed to the Rubik&#x2019;s Cube that had become Eddie&#x2019;s latest obsession. "Hey, anytime you want me to straighten that out for you, let me know."</p><p>He gave a wry grin. "Yeah, right. Like you could."</p><p>Jack shrugged. "Just trying to help the helpless."</p><p>Eddie glanced at his sister stretched on the bed and his grin turned evil. "You too, cave girl. He wants us both out in the"&#x2014; he grabbed his throat and made a strangled sound&#x2014; "fresh air."</p><p>"We were just leaving," Jack said.</p><p>"Where to?"</p><p>"The Pines."</p><p>Eddie shook his head. "No way. Last time I was in there with you two we found a dead guy, and pretty soon a whole bunch of guys were dead."</p><p>Jack shrugged. "Look at it this way: How many times can that happen? Chances of finding another dead guy are almost zilch."</p><p>"You guarantee that?"</p><p>"Let&#x2019;s go," was all Jack said.</p><p>Nothing was guaranteed in the Pines.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Jack : Secret Circles by F.

Readers will require both volumes.<b>&nbsp;</b><b><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;� &nbsp;Volume I includes the original Chinese text, a detailed introduction, maps and comprehensive notes to the text.</b></b><b><b> <b></b></b></b><b><b><b><b><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;� &nbsp;Volume II </b>has 26 appendices which highlight extra fascinating information of special interest - such as Rhinoceroses, the Story of Sea-silk and the Significance and Use of Skull Cups - and the comprehensive bibliography.</b></b></b></b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b>This updated, definitive English translation of the complete Chronicle on the Western Regions from the <i>Hou Hanshu</i>, presents an intriguing picture of this little-known period of history. It describes the origins of the Silk Routes using information collected from soldiers, merchants, envoys and spies. &nbsp;The text is based on the report to the Chinese Emperor An, circa 125 CE, by Ban Yong, his senior general in the Western Regions.&nbsp;<b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b> The Chronicle contains the earliest geographical, historical, political, economic and cultural information in Chinese about the Roman Empire, Egypt, India, Parthia and many other kingdoms, and also describes the routes between East and West.<b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b> Along these arteries travelled people, cultures, languages, philosophies, religions, technologies, animals, plants, countless precious and rare trade items, and the knowledge of distant places. These exchanges were critical for the development and flowering of the great civilizations of China, Rome, Parthia, the Kushans and India, and unquestionably laid the foundations of &nbsp;modern globalisation. <b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b> The first edition of this work received critical acclaim from scholars world-wide and is widely quoted in academic works. This much expanded second edition should prove to be an even more useful guide and source-book on the early history of the Silk Routes.<b><b><b>&nbsp;</b></b></b><b><b><b><b> "This treasure house of remarkable facts and speculations should appeal to both scholars and the curious."</b></b></b></b></p><p>I live with my long-time partner and editor, Jo Wynter, on a remote property in a beautiful tropical forest, west of Cooktown, Queensland, over 300 kilometers (186 miles) from the nearest traffic lights. Although I was born in Montr�al, Canada (in 1943), I grew up in Port of Spain, Trinidad, West Indies. I am of English and French background with a dash of Beothuk - the natives of Newfoundland, who were hounded to extinction in the 1820s or 1830s. As a young man I trained as a Field Assistant and Laboratory Technician in virology in Trinidad. I attended the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. I began working in fisheries research in Alaska both at sea (for a full year) and ashore in Sandpoint in 1962-63. I moved to Australia in January 1964, and am now a citizen. I graduated as a Registered Psychiatric Nurse in Sydney in 1967, and have worked as a nurse in both Australia and Canada. I lived for more than three years in India in 1979-81 doing research on Indian and Tibetan history. I have worked for many years in remote Aboriginal communities in Australia. I am an independent scholar, and have been fascinated by the exchange of peoples, cultures, religions and trade between Asia, Europe and Africa since my youth. I have travelled extensively in Asia since 1973 exploring archaeological sites, museums and routes. I began translating Chinese texts while living in India and have continued gathering information, and communicating with historians, linguists, archaeologists and other specialists around the world ever since. Their many generous contributions have helped make it an authoritative and useful historical source. I published the first edition of this work in 2009 which received scholarly acceptance and compliments world-wide. I believe this revised and much-expanded edition will remain the definitive reference in its field for many years to come.</p><h2>The sham-robbery, committed by Elijah Putnam Goodridge on his own person, in Newbury near Essex bridge, Dec. 19, 1816 : with a history of his journey to the place where he robbed himself : and his trial with Mr. Ebenezer Pearson, whom he maliciously arres</h2><p>Pages 171 It is the reproduction of the old book published long back.

They're even more stunned when an autopsy reveals it wasn't the crash that killed her -- but complications from childbirth. No one even knew that cheerful, reliable, and unmarried Mary Pat was pregnant. In a town where everyone knows everyone's business, how did she hide her pregnancy? Where is her baby? And who is the father? <br><br> These daunting questions lead Police Chief Frank Bennett into the shadowy world of black market adoption scams, where panicked young women and desperate, childless couples play a high-stakes game. to prevent another tragedy, Frank must unravel a tangle of family secrets and unlikely alliances. But stepping closer to the truth puts Frank squarely in a killer's sights. Because when greed and love both fuel the fire, everyone gets burned.</p><p>The town of Trout Run, NY is purely fictional, but it's based on towns I love in the High Peaks region of the Adirondacks: Jay, Wilmington, Keene Valley, and AuSable Forks. &nbsp;Trout Run feels as real to me as any of those locations, and when I write about it, I can practically smell the balsam-scented air and hear the sound of rushing mountain streams.

His previous books include Abrams&#39; Turkana: Kenya&#39;s Nomads of the Jade Sea.The Great Rift Valley encompasses eastern Africa from Ethiopia south to Mozambique and as far west as Rwanda and the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A native of England, Pavitt has lived in Kenya for 45 years and has traveled through as much of the region as wartime conditions permitted. The more than 200 stunning color photographs presented here feature the region's dramatic volcanoes and valleys as well as its people. While he describes some of the surviving indigenous wildlife, his text emphasizes the history of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, and Rwanda, including the great explorers who charted the unknown interior in the 19th century and the customs and traditions of the Maasai, Pokot, Konso, Batwa, and other tribes. The Rift Valley is an ancient land, a probable cradle of humankind, in many inaccessible areas still untouched, but it is also ever-changing owing to global warming, active volcanoes, war, and social disruptions. This is the only book in print on the valley for a general readership; an earlier book, Collin Willock's Africa's Rift Valley (o.p.), emphasized the region's natural history. Despite its price, this is an excellent choice for both public and academic libraries.

They are seldom heard from any more, but for over 30 years Clyde N. Wilson has been examining American history and current events from just such a viewpoint. Wilson, as historian and columnist Joseph Stromberg writes in the foreward, is &#34;the kind of conservative who is a stalwart defender of federalism and republicanism, and the liberties associated with them. Such conservatives are few and far between these days.... &#34;He is ... one a of a vanishing group of professional historians who do not regard Southern life and history as on dark, Gothic misfortune after another.... &#34;What comes of this is the creative deployment of a Southern persective on American history---one that yields interesting and important insights.... &#34;It is hard to do justice to Wilson&#39;s work.... Suffice it to say that there is good, powerful writing here, where an understanding of the value of genuine aristocratic leadership is mixed with the practical wisdom of the plain folk of the South. I have long been waiting for a collection of Wilson&#39;s essays and, having seen it, I can say it is well worth careful adn repeated reading.&#34;</p><p>From Union to Empire: Essays in the Jeffersonian Tradition by Clyde N. Wilson is a selection from his over 300 articles and essays written between 1969 and 2001. A second collection of writings on the South, past, present, and future, is in preparation, tentatively titled &#34;Defending Dixie: Essays in Southern History and Culture.&#34; Clyde N.

Once only familiar to musical experts, later a universal piece for all piano pupils, its opening melody is now even omnipresent as an alienated sinus tone-like mobile phone ring tone.Fazil Say&#39;s arrangement, originally created as an effective encore, follows on from this popularity. After the first eight bars have been presented in original form, typical elements of jazz superimposed on the still recognisable classical foundations can be discovered, such as syncopation of the top notes and ornamentation through chromatic blue notes, embedded in the at times frenzied chains of semiquavers. In the spirit of the work&#39;s improvisatory character, Say likes to perfom his Alla Turca Jazz in different combinations, for example accompanied by jazz singers of with orchestra. It may appear strange that Fazil Say, who was born in Turkey and - when not on tour - is still resident in that country, does not bring back Mozart&#39;s interpretation of genuine Turkish music closer to its own roots, particularly as many of his compositions such as Black Earth or the Violin Sonata are characterised by a subtle amalgamation of the Classical-Romantic tradition, Turkish folk music and elements of jazz. In a further Mozart arrangement, the ballet music Patara premiered in Vienna in 2006, composed on the basis of the Rococo-like theme from the first movement of the same A-major Sonata, Say utilised the connection which was absent in Alla Turca, albeit in the opposite direction.Pages: 8</p><p></p><h2>Kamisama Kiss, Vol. 21 (21)</h2><p>Nanami Momozono is alone and homeless after her dad skips town to evade his gambling debts and the debt collectors kick her out of her apartment.

For a child must be set free to find her own destiny, even if that destiny be the one the mother has foretold</i>."<br><i>And then Great Alta made the straight path crooked before them and the crooked path straight. She set traps for them and pits that they might be comforted when they escaped, that they might remember her loving kindness and rejoice in it</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE LEGEND:<br><i>It was in the town of Slipskin, now called New Moulting, soft into the core of the new year's spring, that three young women, and one of them White Jenna, rode out upon a great gray horse</i>.<br><i>His back was as broad as a barn door, his withers could not be spanned. Each hoof struck fire from the road. Where his feet paced, there crooked paths were made smooth and mountains laid low, straight paths were pitted and gullies cut from the hills</i>.<br><i>There are folk in New Moulting who say it was no horse at all, but a beast sent by Alta herself to carry them over the miles. There are footprints still near the old road into Slipskin, carved right into the stone. And downriver, in the town of Selden, there are three great ribs of the thing set over the church door that all might see them and wonder</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE STORY:<br>The road was a gray ribbon in the moonlight, threading between trees. Five women stood on the road, listening to a ululating cry behind them.<br>Two of the women, Catrona and Katri, were clearly middle-aged, with lines like runes across their brows. They had short-cropped hair and wore their swords with a casual authority.<br>The youngest, Petra, stood with her shoulders squared. There was a defiance in the out-thrust of her chin, but her eyes were softer and her tongue licked her lips nervously.<br>Jenna was the extremely tall girl, not yet a woman for all that her hair was as white as the moonlight. Whiter, as it had no shadows. The other tall girl, but a hairbreadth smaller, and a bit thinner, and dark, was Skada.<br>"I will miss the sound of their voices," Jenna said.<br>"I will not," Skada answered. "Voices have a binding power. It is best for us to look ahead now. We are messengers, not memorizers."<br>"<i>And</i> we have far to go," Catrona said. "With many Hames to warn." She drew a map from her leather pocket and spread the crackling parchment upon the ground. With Katri's help she smoothed it out and pointed to a dark spot. "We are here, Selden Hame. The swiftest route would be there, down the river road into Selden itself, across the bridge. Then we go along the river with our backs to the Old Hanging Man, never losing sight of these twin peaks." She pointed to the arching lines on the map.<br>"Alta's Breast," said Skada.<br>"You learned your lessons well," said Katri.<br>"What Jenna knows, I know."<br>Catrona continued moving her finger along the route. "The road goes on and on, with no forks or false trails to this Hame." Her finger tapped the map twice and Katri's did the same.<br>"Calla's Ford Hame," said Jenna. "Where Selinda and Alna have begun their mission year. It will be good to see them. I have missed them..."<br>"But not much," murmured Skada.<br>"Is it the best place to start?" Jenna asked. "Or should we go farther out? Closer to the king's court?"<br>Catrona smiled. "The Hames are in a great circle. Look here." And she pointed to one after another, calling out the names of the Hames as if in a single long poem. "Selden, Calla's Ford, Wilma's Crossing, Josstown, Calamarie, Carpenter's, Krisston, West Dale, Annsville, Crimerci, Lara's Well, Sammiton, East James, John-o-the-Mill's, Carter's Tracing, North Brook, and Nill's Hame. The king's court is in the center."<br>"So none will complain if we visit Calla's Ford first," Katri said, her finger resting, as did Catrona's, on the last Hame. "As it is closest."<br>"And as our own Hame's children are there," added Catrona.<br>"But we must be quick," Jenna reminded them all.<br>Catrona and Katri stood simultaneously, Catrona folding the map along its old creases. She put it back in the leather pocket and handed it to Petra.<br>"Here, child, in case we should be parted from one another," Catrona said.<br>"But I am the least worthy," Petra said. "Should not Jenna... "<br>"Now that Jenna has seen the map once, she has it for good. She is warrior -trained in the EyeMind Game and could recite the names and places for you even now. Am I right, Jenna?" Catrona asked.<br>Jenna hesitated for a moment, seeing again the map as it had lain under Catrona's hands. She began to recite slowly but with complete confidence, outlining as she spoke with her foot in the road's dirt, "Selden, Calla's Ford, Wilma's Crossing, Josstown..."<br>"I believe you," said Petra, holding out her hand. "I will take the map." She tied the leather pocket's strings around her belt.<br>They started off down the road, walking steadily, each an arm's length apart. There was little sound in their going and Catrona on the right and Jenna on the far left kept careful watch of the road's perimeter. Only young Petra, in the center, seemed in the least uneasy. Once or twice she turned to look behind them, back toward the place where the long, low cry of the Selden Hame farewell had echoed.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE SONG:<br>&nbsp;<br>Anna at the Turning<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Gray in the moonlight, green in the sun</i>,<br><i>Dark in the evening, bright in the dawn</i>,<br><i>Ever the meadow goes endlessly on</i>,<br><i>And Anna at each turning</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Sweet in the springtide, sour in fall</i>,<br><i>Winter casts snow, a white velvet caul</i>.<br><i>Passage in summer is swiftest of all</i>, <br><i>And Anna at each turning</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Look to the meadows and look to the hills</i>,<br><i>Look to the rocks where the swift river spills</i>,<br><i>Look to the farmland the farmer still tills</i><br><i>For Anna is returning</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>THE STORY:<br>They stopped only once in the woods to sleep under a blackthorn tree by a swift-flowing stream. Taking turns, they kept the night watch, leaving Petra the shortest time, and that near dawn when she would have awakened anyway. Besides, as Catrona reminded them, with the moon they watched in pairs and Petra was alone.<br>There was nothing to disturb their rest except the mourning of owls back and forth across the stream, and the constant murmur of the water. Once on Jenna and Skada's watch, there was a light crackle of underbrush.<br>"Hare," Jenna whispered to her dark sister, alert for more.<br>"Hare," Skada agreed. They both relaxed. Slightly.<br>By early eve of the next day they had passed the outlying farms of Slipskin, neatly tilled land, well cleared of rocks and roots by generations of farmers. Each acre was gently fuzzed over with green. In one field twenty horses were pastured on blue-green grass.<br>"There," said Catrona, "a man who sells horses. Probably supplies the king. We could <i>borrow</i> one or two and he would never know the difference."<br>Petra shook her head. "We had horses and flocks at my Hame. Believe me, our shepherds knew every beast by name."<br>Catrona snorted. "I know that, child. Just testing."<br>"I will <i>not</i> ride a horse again," Jenna said. "Once was enough."<br>"I doubt we could get three off him anyway," Catrona said. "But if we could get one, one of us could ride ahead. We need swiftness whatever the cost."<br>Unhappily, Jenna had to agree.<br>"Let me do the talking," Catrona added. "I have spent much time among men and know what to say."<br>"I have spent no time at all with them," admitted Petra.<br>Jenna said nothing, but her finger strayed to her lips and she was glad that it was still daylight and Skada not there to remind her just what she had--and had not--said to Carum when he had kissed her. Two men she had known: one she had kissed and one she had killed. She knew as little as Petra. "Yes, you speak," she said to Catrona. "We will wait behind."<br>"But mind you, look fetching," said Catrona.<br>"Fetching?" Jenna asked, genuinely puzzled.<br>"Men like that." Catrona threw back her head, laughing loudly.<br>Although they weren't sure what Catrona meant by <i>fetching</i>, both Jenna and Petra managed to smile at the farmer when he opened the dark wood door. He stared at them for a moment, as if unsure of what he was seeing, then called over his shoulder, "Marline, Martine, come quick."<br>"What is it?" a voice called from the room behind him.<br>He did not speak again until his wife, a rosy giantess, stood next to him, a full head higher than his own balding crown.<br>"There, the big girl, look at 'er. Look, woman."<br>She stared as well.<br>"We are Alta's own," Catrona began, stopping when she saw that they were paying no attention to her but were rather staring at Jenna. She spoke again, loudly. "My name is Catrona, from Selden Hame. My sisters and I..."<br>"By the blessing, Geo, you are right. Who else could it be," the farmer's wife said, her cheeks bright red. "Except for the hair, she's the spit of my poor dead sister."<br>Catrona suddenly understood. "You think Jenna a fosterling from your family? Of all houses, that we should have stopped here."<br>"Naaa, naaa," the farmer said, shaking his head and sounding remarkably like a penned beast. "She has eleven sisters, and all the same. Not fifty years ago the hillsides would've been full of 'em. But we got low on girls 'round here and so now girls is a commodity. You be thinking of staying, I could set you up with good husbands." He shook his head again. "Well, the niece, maybe, and the little one there. We need breeders, you know. That's why Marline's sisters, they all got spoke for early. Good stock. Not a holding this side of the Slip don't house one of 'em. <i>T'would be harder to miss one than find one</i>, as they say of blackbirds in a flock. It would be..."<br>Martine pushed her husband aside and walked past Catrona to Jenna's side. Together, their relationship was obvious. "She has the Dougal height, the Hiat eyes, remember Geo like you said when we was courtin', my eyes was <i>dark eyes of a spring</i>. And my sister Ardeen went white afore she was fifteen, and my sister Jarden afore she was twenty. Give your aunt a hug, girl."<br>Jenna did not move, her mind whirling.<br>"Her mother was bringing her to us to foster, out in the woods when a cat killed her," Catrona said. "My own sisters gave yours a decent grave and said the words you like over her. Her fosterer died, or I would tell her of you."<br>"Nonsense!" Martine said, turning from Jenna to speak directly to Catrona. "Her mother died at birth. Lay there bleeding like a pig stuck for market while the mid-wife bore the child away. If your sister fostered her, then ... " She stopped a minute and counted on her fingers. "One for my poor dead sister, two for the midwife, and three be your sister. Oh, my Blessed be!" She dropped suddenly to her knees, her hands covering her mouth. "The White One, triple mothered. Of my own flesh and blood. Who could have guessed?"<br>Her husband went down more slowly, as if he had been pole-axed, and buried his face in his hands.<br>Jenna rolled her eyes up and sighed. She heard Petra's quick intake of breath and priestess voice behind her.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Mothered Three,</i><br><i>Blessed be.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Stop that," she hissed back at the girl.<br>From her knees, Martine heard only the rhyme. She put her hands up, palms together, and cried out, "Yes, yes, that's it. Oh, White One, what can we do? What can we say?"<br>"As for what you can do," Catrona said quickly, "you can give us three good horses, for we are on a great mission of mercy and it would not do for the White One to walk. And as for what you can say, you can say yes to us and no to any man who asks."<br>"Yes, yes," Martine cried again, and when her husband did not answer fast enough, she elbowed him.<br>He rose, still not looking again at Jenna, and mumbled, "Yes, yes, I can give you three. And they will be good. Anyone says Geo Hosfetter gives not good horses is..." He sidled out of the door still talking. They could hear his footsteps going away at a run.<br>"I will go and help him choose," said Catrona.<br>"Let the White One stay a moment more," begged Martine. "She is my own flesh, my own blood. Let her tell me her own tale. I have tea. I have cakes." She gestured in toward the neat, well-lit kitchen.<br>Jenna opened her mouth to accept and Petra whispered by her ear, "Dark sisters will be there. Let me talk." Jenna closed her mouth and looked stern.<br>"The White One does not break bread with any. She fasts on this mission and has taken a vow of silence until it is done. I am Her priestess and Her mouth."<br>Jenna rolled her eyes up again, but kept silent.<br>"Of course, of course," Martine said, wiping her hands on her apron.<br>"Better that you tell Her all you know so She may weigh its significance."<br>"Of course, of course," Martine said again. "What shall I tell? That my sister, the White One's mother, was tall and red-haired and made, we all thought, like the rest of us for easy birthing. But something was twisted up there. She died giving the child life. And then that wicked midwife stole the babe away, afore any of us got to see it. We knew the child was a girl because she told her own daughter she was taking it to one of the...you know...Homes."<br>"Hames," Petra corrected automatically.<br>"The closest one. Up the road and into the mountains, it was."<br>"Selden Hame," Petra prompted.<br>But the woman could only tell the story in her own meandering way. "Selling the babe, most likely. Some midwives be like that, you know." Suddenly afraid she might have offended them, she added quickly, "Not that you Alters buy children. Not that."<br>"We reap the hillsides; we do not pay the sowers," said Petra.<br>"I meant that. Yes, I did." Martine's hands wrangled with one another.<br>"And the father?"<br>"Died not a year later. Heart broken. Lost wife and child all to once. And crazed. Saw Alter women everywhere, he did. On the farm. At the hearth. In his bed. Two at a time. Double crazed he was." She shook her head. "Poor man."<br>"Poor man," Petra echoed, her voice soothingly soft.<br>Jenna bit her lip. <i>Her</i> mother. <i>Her</i> father. She tried to credit it and could not. Her mother had not lived under such a cozy, thatched roof, dying with her thighs covered in blood. Her mothers--and there were many of them--lived in Selden Hame. And they would not die in blood if she could help it. She turned abruptly and left Marline of the wrangling hands to Petra's comforting. Striding quickly across the farmyard, she headed toward the barn.<br>The sky above was a steely blue, and a bright pink sat on the horizon behind the barn and the fields. Once the sun slipped below the world's rim, there would be another hour before dark. And then there would be a moon. With the moon, the dark sisters Skada and Karri would reappear. Petra had been right to warn her about going into the candle-lit kitchen. Hearthlight and candlelight could also call the sisters out.

Now, ten years later, her cousin's widower, Marc Devlin, had returned to Charleston to give his young son a true Southern Christmas.<br>It was a chance to make amends in a family torn apart by the tragedy&#x2014;and the suspicion that Marc was responsible for his wife's demise. But when several dangerous "accidents" occurred amid the colorful holiday celebrations, Dinah's recollections of that past dark night began to resurface. Would she discover a killer inside the man she'd grown to love?</p><p>Marta Perry realized she wanted to be a writer at age eight, when she read her first Nancy Drew novel. A lifetime spent in rural Pennsylvania and her own Pennsylvania Dutch roots led Marta to the books she writes now about the Amish. When she&#x2019;s not writing, Marta is active in the life of her church and enjoys traveling and spending time with her three children and six beautiful grandchildren. Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.<p>"Why is he coming back now?"</p> <p>Aunt Kate put her morning cup of Earl Grey back in the saucer as she asked the question for what had to be the twentieth time since they'd heard the news, her faded blue eyes puckered with distress. December sunlight streamed through the lace curtains on the bay window in the breakfast room, casting into sharp relief the veins that stood out on her hand, pressed to the polished tabletop.</p> <p>"I don't know, Aunt Kate."</p> <p>Love swept through Dinah Westlake, obliterating her own fears about Marc Devlin's return to Charleston. She covered the trembling hand with her own, trying to infuse her great-aunt with her own warmth. Anger sparked. Marc shouldn't come back, upsetting their lives once again.</p> <p>"Maybe he just wants to sell the house since the Farriers moved out."Aunt Kate sounded hopeful, and she glanced toward the front window and the house that stood across the street in the quiet Charleston historic block.</p> <p>Annabel's house. The house where Annabel died. Dinah forced herself to focus on the question. "I suppose so. Do you know if he's bringing Court?"</p> <p>Her cousin Annabel's son had been three when she'd seen him last, and now he was thirteen. She remembered a soft, cuddly child who'd snuggled up next to her, begging for just one more bedtime story. It was unlikely that Courtney would want or need anything from her now.</p> <p>"I don't know." Aunt Kate's lips firmed into a thin line. "I hope not."</p> <p>Dinah blinked. "Don't you want to see Courtney?" This visit was the first indication that Marc would let his son have a relationship with his mother's kin that consisted of more than letters, gifts and brief thank-you notes.</p> <p>Tears threatened to spill over onto her great-aunt's soft cheeks. "Of course I do. But that poor child shouldn't be exposed to the house where his mother died, even if it means I never see him again."</p> <p>"Aunt Kate&#x2014;" Dinah's words died. She couldn't say anything that would make a difference, because she understood only too well what her aunt felt. She, too, had not been back in that house since Annabel's funeral.</p> <p>Except in the occasional nightmare. Then, she stood again on the graceful curving staircase of Annabel and Marc's house, looking down toward the dim hallway, hearing angry voices from the front parlor. Knowing something terrible was about to happen. Unable to prevent it.</p> <p>"Everyone will start talking about Annabel's death again." Aunt Kate touched a lacy handkerchief to her eyes, unable as always to say the uglier word. Murder. "Just when it's forgotten, people will start to talk again."</p> <p>Something recoiled in Dinah. It seemed so disloyal never to talk about Annabel. Still, if that was how Aunt Kate dealt with the pain, maybe it was better than having nightmares.</p> <p>She slid her chair back, patting her aunt's hand. "Don't worry about it too much. I'm sure people are so busy getting ready for the Christmas holidays that Marc will have been and gone before anyone takes notice."</p> <p>Her aunt clasped her hand firmly. "You're not going to the office today, are you? Dinah, you have to stay home. What if he comes?"</p> <p>It was no use pointing out to her that Dinah was going to police headquarters, not an office. Aunt Kate couldn't possibly refer to her as a forensic artist. In Aunt Kate's mind, a Charleston lady devoted herself to the church, charity and society, not necessarily in that order.</p> <p>"I thought I'd check in this morning." As a freelance police artist she only worked when called on, but she'd found it helped her acceptance with the detectives to remind them of her presence now and then.</p> <p>"Please, Dinah. Stay home today."</p> <p>Her hesitation lasted only an instant. Aunt Kate had taken care of her. Now it was her turn. She bent to press her cheek against Aunt Kate's.</p> <p>"Of course I will, if that's what you want. But given the way he's cut ties with us, I don't expect Marcus Devlin to show up on our doorstep anytime soon."</p> <p>Was she being a complete coward? Maybe so. But she'd fought her way back from the terror of the night Annabel died, and she had no desire to revisit that dreadful time.</p> <p><i>Please, God. Please let me forget.</i></p> <p>That was a petition that was hardly likely to be granted, now that Marc Devlin was coming home.</p> <p>After helping her aunt to the sunroom that looked over her garden, where she would doze in the winter sunshine, Dinah cleared the breakfast dishes. It was one of the few things Alice Jones, her aunt's devoted housekeeper, allowed her to do to help.</p> <p>Alice was nearly as old as her great-aunt, and the two of them couldn't hope to stay on in the elegant, inconvenient antebellum house on Tradd Street if she weren't here. She wasn't even sure when she'd gone from being the cosseted little girl of the house to being the caretaker, but she didn't see the situation changing anytime soon, and she wouldn't want it to.</p> <p>A sound disturbed the morning quiet. Someone wielded the brass dolphin knocker on the front door with brisk energy. It could be anyone. Her stomach tightened; the back of her neck prickled. Instinct said it was Marc.</p> <p>Heart thudding, she crossed the Oriental carpet that had covered the hall floor for a hundred years or so. She turned the brass doorknob and opened the door.</p> <p>Instinct was right. Her cousin's husband stood on the covered veranda, hand arrested halfway to the knocker.A shaft of winter sunlight, filtered through the branches of the magnolia tree, struck hair that was still glossy black.</p> <p>For a moment, Dinah could only stare. It was Marc, of course, but in another sense it wasn't. This wasn't the intent, idealistic young prosecutor her teenage dreams had idolized.</p> <p>"Dinah." He spoke first, his deep voice breaking the spell that held her silent. "It's been a long time."</p> <p>"Not by our choice," she said, before thinking about the implication.</p> <p>The lines around his firm mouth deepened. "I know." He quirked one eyebrow, and the familiar movement broke through her sense of strangeness. "Are you going to let me come in?"</p> <p>She felt her cheeks warm. What was she doing, keeping him standing on the veranda like a door-to-door salesperson? No matter how much his return distressed Aunt Kate, she couldn't treat him as anything but the cousin-in-law he'd always been to her.</p> <p>She stepped back. "Please, come in." She grasped for the comfort of ingrained manners. "It's good to see you again, Marc."</p> <p>He stepped into the wide center hallway, the movement seeming to stir the quiet air, and she had to suppress a gasp as pain gripped her heart. Forgotten? No, she hadn't forgotten at all. His presence brought her ten-year-old grief surging to life.</p> <p>Was being here doing the same for him? She thought it might&#x2014;his face had tightened, but that was all. He was better at hiding his feelings than he used to be.</p> <p>She had to say something, anything, to bridge the silence. She took refuge in the ordinary. "Did you have a pleasant flight?"</p> <p>He shrugged. "Not bad. I'd forgotten how warm South Carolina can be in December."</p> <p>"That just shows how much of a Northerner you've become. Everyone here has been complaining that it's too cold."</p> <p>His face relaxed into a half smile. "Wimp.You should try a Boston winter sometime to see what cold really is."</p> <p>"No, thanks. I'll pass."</p> <p>He had changed. He was ten years older, of course. Ten years would change anyone. He looked&#x2014;successful, she supposed. Dress shirt, dark tie, a tweed jacket that fit smoothly over broad shoulders, a flash of gold at his wrist that was probably an expensive watch. Being a corporate attorney instead of a prosecutor must suit him.</p> <p>But it wasn't so much the way he was dressed as the air about him&#x2014;the air of a successful, accomplished man.</p> <p>"Well?" He lifted that eyebrow again. "What's the verdict, Dinah?"</p> <p>She wouldn't pretend to misunderstand him. "I was thinking that you talk faster than you used to."</p> <p>He smiled. "I had to learn because no one would stick around long enough to hear what I had to say."</p> <p>The smile was a reminder of the Marc she'd known. <i>Dear Father, this is harder than I'd imagined it could be. Please, get me through it.</i></p> <p>"Come into the parlor." However much she might wish he'd leave, she couldn't stand here in the hall with him.</p> <p>She turned and walked into the small, perfectly appointed front parlor. He'd find this familiar, she supposed. Aunt Kate hadn't changed anything in seventy years, and she never would. Anything that showed wear was replaced with an exact duplicate. Aunt Kate didn't bother to decorate for Christmas much in recent years, but the white mantel bore its usual evergreen, magnolia leaves and holly, studded with the fat ivory candles that would be lit Christmas Eve.</p> <p>Dinah sat on the Queen Anne love seat, gesturing to the wing chair opposite. Marc sat, leaning back, seeming very much at ease. But the lines on his face deepened, and his dark eyes hid secrets.</p> <p>"You've changed." His comment startled her, but it shouldn't. Hadn't she just been thinking the same about him? No one stayed the same for ten years.</p> <p>"I'm ten years older. That makes a difference." Especially when it was the difference between an immature teen and an adult woman.</p> <p>He shook his head. "It's not just that. You're not shy anymore."</p> <p>"I've learned to hide it better, that's all."</p> <p>Marc <i>would</i> remember the shy, gawky teenager she'd once been. She could only hope he'd never noticed the crush she'd had on him.</p> <p>"It's easy to see that you're blooming. How is Aunt Kate?"</p> <p>And how, exactly, was she going to explain the fact that Aunt Kate wasn't coming in to greet him?</p> <p>"She's...older, obviously. She'd deny it vehemently, but she's begun to fail a little."</p> <p>"So you're taking care of her."</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>That's how it is in families, Marc. We take care of each other. We don't walk away, the way you did.</p> <p>He frowned slightly, and she had the uncomfortable sense that he knew what she was thinking.</p> <p>"Is she too frail to see me?"</p> <p>Her careful evasion had led her just where she didn't want to be. "No. She just&#x2014;"</p> <p>She faltered to a halt. There wasn't any good way of saying that Aunt Kate didn't welcome his return.</p> <p>"She just doesn't want to see me." His mouth thinned. "Tell me, does she think I killed Annabel?"</p> <p>The blunt question shook her, and mentioning Annabel's name seemed to bring her into the room. For an instant Dinah heard the light tinkle of Annabel's laugh, caught a whiff of the sophisticated fragrance that had been Annabel's scent. Grief ripped through her, and she struggled to speak.</p> <p>"I&#x2014;I'm sure she doesn't think that." But did she? With her firm avoidance of the subject, Aunt Kate had managed never to say.</p> <p>His dark gaze seemed to reject the feeble words. "What about you, Dinah? Do you think that?"</p> <p>Before she could find the words, he shook his head. "Never mind. I don't suppose it matters."</p> <p>She found the words then, at the pain in his voice. "I don't think you could have hurt Annabel."</p> <p>How could anyone have hurt Annabel, have struck out and destroyed all that life, all that beauty?</p> <p>His face seemed to relax a fraction. "Thank you. I'm selling the house. I suppose you guessed that."</p> <p>"We thought that was probably why you'd come back," she said cautiously, not wanting to make it sound as if that was what she wanted.</p> <p>"It's time. Having the Farriers rent the place all these years let me drift, but when they decided to move, I knew I had to do something about the house."</p></p><h2>The FOUR DIMENSIONS OF PHILOSOPHY, METAPHYSICAL, MORAL OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL</h2><p>This book is about philosophy&#39;s relationship to and difference from other disciplines, such as history, maths, physics, and even poetry. The author demonstrates how philosophy - like history, but unlike physics - is reflexive. That is, one may write a history of history as well as a history of physics, but not a physics of physics.</p><p>Mortimer J. Adler is Chairman of the Board of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Director of the Institute for Philosophical Research, and Honorary Trustee of the Aspen Institute.&nbsp; He has authored fifty books.&nbsp; He lives in Chicago.An often profound, if sometimes tedious, discourse on the four dimensions of philosophy--the ``metaphysical,'' the ``moral,'' the ``objective,'' and the ``categorical''--by the vastly prolific, 91- year-old Adler. In his 53rd book, Adler (Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclopaedia Britannica; A Second Look in the Rearview Mirror, 1992, etc.) attempts to answer such questions as: ``What is the scope of the philosophical enterprise?''; ``What is its method?''; ``What are the criteria of excellence in philosophical work?'' The author extensively examines how philosophy relates to and differs from other intellectual disciplines, such as science and history. Arguing that ``philosophy is everybody's business,'' he makes a strong case that, of all the disciplines, only philosophy is truly contemplative and ``reflexive'' enough to challenge the highest qualities of the human mind and spirit. Moving to the defensive, Adler attempts to explain why philosophy is generally regarded as pragmatically inferior to science. He contends that philosophy has been confused with archaic scientific and religious inquiry, and that in modern times it ``has been suffering from the cultural preeminence of science.'' While highly critical of 20th-century philosophy, as well as of modern efforts to reform it, the author promises a brighter future for philosophy as soon as we learn to ``preserve, consolidate and enhance'' those more positive features of it that can affect our society in a practical way. He argues that philosophy deserves more respect for the potential role it can play in education, as well as in ``the hierarchy of elements that constitute culture and civilization.'' The book--which Adler hints may be his last--concludes with an outline of a wide spectrum of philosophical topics and subjects, ranging from God to wealth. Erudite and richly contemplative--but Adler's belabored prose style may deter many. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Competition. Prejudice. Discrimination. Conflict. In 1954, a group of boys attended a remote summer camp where they were split into two groups, and forced to bully, harass, and demonise members of the other group. The results would make history as one of social psychology&#39;s classic studies: the Robbers Cave experiment. Conducted at the height of the Cold War, officially the experiment had a happy ending: the boys reconciled, and psychologist Muzafer Sherif demonstrated that while hatred and violence are powerful forces, so too are cooperation and harmony. Today it is proffered as proof that under the right conditions warring groups can make peace. Yet the true story of the experiments is far more complex, and more chilling. In The Lost Boys, Gina Perry explores the experiment and its consequences, tracing the story of Sherif, a troubled outsider who struggled to craft an experiment that would vanquish his personal demons. Drawing on archival material and new interviews, Perry pieces together a story of drama, mutiny, and intrigue that has never been told before.</p><p>Gina Perry is an Australian psychologist and writer.

It makes no sense: she has never been shot. She has no entry wound. No scar. Then, over the course of one awful evening, she learns the truth: that she was adopted when she was three years old, after her real parents were murdered.

Given all the violence to come, you were probably expecting someone different. A Lara Croft type. Young and gorgeous, sporting taut biceps and a thigh holster, right? Admit it.<br> <br>Yes, all right, fine, I am pretty enough. I have long, dark hair and liquid, chocolate eyes and hourglass hips. I see the way men stare. But there&#x2019;s no holster strapped to these thighs. For starters, I am thirty-seven years old. Not old, not yet, but old enough to know better.<br> <br>Then there is the matter of how I spend my days. That would be in the library, studying the work of dead white men. I am an academic, a professor on Georgetown University&#x2019;s Faculty of Languages and Linguistics. My specialty is nineteenth-century France: Balzac, Flaubert, Sten�dhal, Zola. The university is generous enough to fly me to Paris every year or so, but most of the time you&#x2019;ll find me in the main campus library, glasses sliding down my nose, buried in old books. Every few hours I&#x2019;ll stir, cross the quad to deliver a lecture, scold a student requesting extra time for an assignment&#x2014;and then I return to my books. I read with my legs tucked beneath me, in a soft, blue armchair in a sunny corner of my office nook on the fourth floor. Most nights you will also find me there, sipping tea, typing away, grading papers. Are you getting a sense for the rhythm of my days? I lead as stodgy a life as you can imagine.<br> <br>But it was by doing just this, by following this exact routine, that I came to schedule the medical appointment that changed everything.<br> <br>For months, my wrist had hurt. It began as an occasional tingling. That changed to a sharp pain that shot down my fingers. The pain got worse and worse until my fingers turned so clumsy, my grip so weak, that I could barely carry my bags. My doctor diagnosed too much typing. Too much hunching over books. To be precise&#x2014;I like to be �precise&#x2014;he diagnosed CTS. Carpal tunnel syndrome. He suggested wearing a wrist splint at night and elevating my keyboard. That helped, but not much.<br> <br>And so it was that I found myself one morning in the waiting room of Washington Radiology Associates. I was scheduled for an MRI, to &#x201c;rule out arthritis and get to the bottom of what&#x2019;s going on,&#x201d; as my doctor put it.<br> <br>It was the morning of Wednesday, October 9.

Understandable since it was also the home of Schiller, H�lderlin, M�rike, Weiland, Uhland, Schlegel, Hegel, Schelling and Herman Hesse. Uhlman's name is not out of place among these, and the beauty of that birthplace illuminates every line of his stunning fictional memoir <i>Reunion</i>.

With the utmost delicacy and care, Uhlman distils all the rage and tragedy of the second world war into one brief childhood friendship, and the final line is the most shattering of any novel I know.

Local residents are mostly supportive, but at the grand opening, a farmer who claims products without wheat go against God throws flour on Toni and others. When the farmer is murdered in front of the bakery, Toni becomes the main suspect. Meanwhile, a subplot involving Toni&#x2019;s friend&#x2019;s boyfriend provides surprises and a little edginess. Intrepid sleuth Toni and her supporting cast are believable and fun, and the gluten-free angle adds a new twist to food fiction. The motive for the murder is a bit farfetched&#x2014;a common flaw in cozies starring amateur sleuths&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t detract much from what is an enjoyable read in a promising new series.

Yolen's short ode to evening touches upon the moon and fireflies, moths, an owl, and small nocturnal animals. Double-page paintings of a nighttime countryside feature flat figures of a boy, his mother, and their dog outside their lighted house. Hunter's simple scenes are nicely textured with cross hatching, and her homely animal portraits?a bat in flight, a squirrel asleep in a tree hole, a raccoon, an owl, and a sleeping dog?are appealing. The simple scheme of winding down the day ends first in the boy's bedroom?"Tucked up under eiderdown/I nestle down, wrestle down/my hullaballooning thoughts/and drift through dark into dreams." The concluding dreamscape places the boy's bed back in the outdoors amid the grasses, fireflies, and night sky.

It is a particularly English phenomenon specific to London and the seaside resorts of Brighton and Hove where they serve a flourishing tourist trade. There have also been small outcrops of cards on the coast of North Lincolnshire that cater for a transient maritime population. Elsewhere in the UK, prostitutes still hold to the older methods of notices in shop windows although advertising in local newspapers is also used. <p>Behind the cards there is a vibrant and well-organised industry that comprises prostitutes, punters [clients], pimps and printers. It is an illicit business, but one that is thriving and persistent and where money changes hands swiftly and inconspicuously. Carding started as a kitchen table industry with a handful of prostitutes and their maids cutting out images, drawing their own illustrations, rubbing down lettering and then passing it all over to a trusted printer. It has developed into an extensive, professional, well-organised and highly technical production process that utilises the latest manufacturing systems. -Caroline Archer, from "Foreplay" the introduction to Tart Cards.</p></p><h2>Little Pictures of Japan</h2><p>191 pages - Childs picture book with poetry and color illustrations.</p><p></p><h2>Blowing Up Russia</h2><p>Blowing Up Russia contains the allegations of ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko against his former spymasters in Moscow which led to his being murdered in London in November 2006.

When she loses her beloved Maurice to a long and horrible illness, she seems beyond help: she resents the neighbors&#x2019; well-meaning questions and concerns and she&#x2019;s so grief stricken she barely notices how her children are suffering. Nora is not entirely likable&#x2014;a self-centered person mired in depression rarely is. But Nora is also proud, fierce and angry&#x2014;and slowly, slowly she wins you over. Even more important, she eventually finds a way to save herself. This is not a novel that makes a lot of noise&#x2014;and yet it&#x2019;s musical. It has a kind of deliberate, note-by-note crescendo&#x2014;but very few crashing cymbals&#x2014;as Nora rediscovers her love of singing, learns how art can help her navigate through grief, and how music can help even the most quiet among us to regain our voice. &#x2013; <i>Sara Nelson</i></p>COLM TOIBIN is the award-winning author of seven previous internationally acclaimed novels, including the Booker finalist <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>; <i>The Master</i>, winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and Le Prix du meilleur livre etranger, and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize for Fiction; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Novel Award, and finalist for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award and soon to be a major motion picture; and The <i>Testament of Mary</i>, a finalist for the Man Booker Prize.

Their offereings included majestic Western waterfalls, magnificent portraits, sprawling landscapes--the cream of a nation ready to assert itself culturally as it had begun to do so economically. The Americans sat back to bask in anticipated applause.<br><br>But their confidence would be shattered when the luminaries of the French Academy condemned the spectacle as being unworthy of the great nation that had produced it. The rebuke provoked widespread soulsearching in America: Why was the land of Melville and Poe unable to produce paintings of comparable power? How was it to claim a place among nations producing art of real consequence?<br><br>In this magnificent historical panorama, Annie Cohen-Solal shows how American pragmatism furnished the solution: Learn from the best. The French were then the undisputed masters of painting, and so to France the Americans went in hordes, apprenticing themselves in the studios of reknowned masters--G�r�me, Cabanel, and others--or founding colonies such as the legendary one at Pont-Aven. From the seeds of their individual efforts would grow an extraordinary crop, one that included not only the great--Whistler, Cassatt, Sargent--but a legion of artists of all ranks who collectively pushed forward a bold new American enterprise. In two generations, Paris would be eclipsed, and the greatest French artists would begin coming to New York to be at the new center of everything.<br><br>Meticulously researched and presented as a captivating story, this book tells the saga of the rise of American artists as we have never had it before: a surging transatlatic ebb and flow of cultural energies, driven by innumberable fascinating individuals--painters, collectors, critics, titans of industry--some of them now famous, others forgotten. Informed throughout by the author's unique perspective as a scholar, a writer, and a cultural diplomat, <b>Painting American</b> offers an utterly new understanding of one of the greatest changes in cultural history.</p><p>In the 19th century, American artists had to travel to France for validation; by the mid 20th century, the center of the art world had shifted to the United States. How did this happen? The French author of <i>Sartre: A Life</i>, Annie Cohen-Solal traces this shift in the balance of aesthetic power in the sparsely illustrated volume <i>Painting American</i>. Little more than a rehash of the relevant portions of French and American art history, it will not appeal to specialists looking for major new findings or novel interpretations. But it may be just the ticket for anyone curious about what the sober ranks of 19th-century American artists were learning in the heady world of Parisian art or the motives of American philanthropists who brought European art to the U.S. Particularly welcome is the unusual attention paid to developments in American art outside New York. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i>"Annie Cohen-Solal writes with the confident authority and mesmerizing observations of a modern-day de Tocqueville. With one brilliantly argued point after another, she has connected the two worlds of American and French (European) painting, exposed the obvious differences and demonstrated their utter independence. Though it reads like a page-turning detective novel, it is destined to remain the seminal work on this subject for a very long time. Bravo." --Ken Burns<br><br>"'The imagination is not dead,' Alexis de Tocqueville observed of America more than a century ago, but it can only 'conceive what may be useful and portray what is actual.' His worry that a country without an aristocracy would be incapable of producing great art has finally been dispelled in Annie Cohen Solal's masterful study of the foundations and flowering of American painting. Her book demonstrates brilliantly that in a democracy of desire artistic beauty blossoms forth in all modes of expression." --John Patrick Diggins, Distinguished Professor of History, Graduate Center, City University of New York<br><br>"A thoughtfully conceived, well-executed study of France's influence on American art--and vice versa.... Literate, accessible, and a pleasure to read: worthy to stand on a shelf next to Roger Shattuck's <i>The Banquet Years </i>and Robert Hughes's <i>The Shock of the New.</i>"--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><h2>All These Things I&#39;ve Done: A Novel (Birthright, 1)</h2><p><p>In 2083, chocolate and coffee are illegal, paper is hard to find, water is carefully rationed, and New York City is rife with crime and poverty. And yet, for Anya Balanchine, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the city's most notorious (and dead) crime boss, life is fairly routine. It consists of going to school, taking care of her siblings and her dying grandmother, trying to avoid falling in love with the new assistant D.A.'s son, and avoiding her loser ex-boyfriend. That is until her ex is accidently poisoned by the chocolate her family manufactures and the police think she's to blame. Suddenly, Anya finds herself thrust unwillingly into the spotlight--at school, in the news, and most importantly, within her mafia family. </p><p>From Gabrielle Zevin--the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Elsewhere--</i>comes <i>All These Things I've Done</i>, a masterful novel about an impossible romance, a mafiya family, and the ties that forever bind us.</p></p><p><p><b>Gabrielle Zevin</b> is the author of award-winning books for young adults including <i>Memoirs of a Teenage Amnesiac</i> and <i>Elsewhere</i>.

Not in the distant or semidistant future either. Right then.</p> Admittedly, my taste in boys wasn&#x2019;t so great. I was attracted to the sort who weren&#x2019;t in the habit of asking permission to do anything. Boys like my father, I guess. We&#x2019;d just gotten back from the coffee speakeasy that used to be off University Place, in the basement of a church. This was back when caffeine, along with about a million other things, was against the law. So much was illegal (paper without a permit, phones with cameras, chocolate, etc.) and the laws changed so quickly, you could be committing a crime and not even know it. Not that it mattered. The boys in blue were totally overwhelmed. The city was bankrupt, and I&#x2019;d say maybe 75 percent of the force had been fired. The police that were left didn&#x2019;t have time to worry about teens getting high on coffee. I should have known something was up when Gable offered to escort me back to the apartment. At night at least, it was a pretty dangerous trek from the speakeasy to where I lived on East Ninetieth, and Gable usually left me to fend for myself. He lived downtown, and I guess he figured that I hadn&#x2019;t been killed making the trip yet. We went into my apartment, which had been in the family practically forever&#x2014;since 1995, the year my grandma Galina was born. Galina, who we called Nana and who I loved like nobody&#x2019;s business, was busy dying in her bedroom. She had the distinction of being both the oldest and the sickest person I had ever known. As soon as I opened the door, I could hear the machines that were keeping her heart and everything else pumping. The only reason they hadn&#x2019;t turned the machines off, like they would have for anyone else, was because she was responsible for my older brother, my little sister, and me. Her mind was still sharp, by the way. Even confined to the bed, not much got past her. Gable had had, maybe, six espressos that night, two of them with shots of Prozac (also illegal)&#x2014;and he was mad up. I&#x2019;m not making excuses for him, only trying to explain a few things. &#x201c;Annie,&#x201d; he said, loosening his necktie and sitting down on the couch, &#x201c;you gots to have some chocolate in here. I know you do. I&#x2019;m gagging for it. Come on, baby, hook Daddy up.&#x201d; It was the caffeine talking. Gable sounded like a different person when he was on the stuff. I especially hated when he referred to himself as Daddy. I think he&#x2019;d heard it in an old movie. I wanted to say, <i>You aren&#x2019;t my daddy. You&#x2019;re seventeen years old, for God&#x2019;s sake.</i>Sometimes I did say this but mostly I let it go. My actual daddy used to say that if you didn&#x2019;t let some things go, you&#x2019;d spend your whole life fighting. Chocolate was why Gable&#x2019;d said he wanted to come up to the apartment in the first place. I told him he could have one piece and then he had to leave. The first day of school was tomorrow (my junior year as I mentioned; his senior), and I needed to get some sleep. We kept our chocolate in Nana&#x2019;s room in a secret safe in the back of her closet. I tried to be real quiet as I walked past her bed. Not that there was much of a need for that. Her machines were as loud as the subway. Nana&#x2019;s room smelled like death, a combination of day-old egg salad (poultry was rationed) and overripe honeydew melons (fruit was pretty scarce) and old shoes and cleaning products (purchase permitted with voucher). I went into her walk-in closet, pushed her coats out of the way, and entered the combination. Behind the guns was the chocolate, which was superdark, with hazelnuts, and came from Russia. I put a bar in my pocket and closed the safe. On my way out, I stopped to kiss my grandmother on the cheek, and she woke up. &#x201c;Anya,&#x201d; she croaked, &#x201c;what time did you get home?&#x201d; I told her that I&#x2019;d been home for a while. She&#x2019;d never know the difference anyway and she&#x2019;d only worry if she knew where I&#x2019;d been. Then I told her to go back to sleep, that I hadn&#x2019;t meant to wake her. &#x201c;You need your rest, Nana.&#x201d; &#x201c;What for? I&#x2019;ll be resting forever soon enough.&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk like that. You&#x2019;ll be alive a really long time,&#x201d; I lied. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a difference between being alive and living,&#x201d; shemuttered before changing the subject. &#x201c;First day of school tomorrow.&#x201d; I was surprised she remembered. &#x201c;Go get yourself a nice chocolate bar from the closet, okay, Anyaschka?&#x201d; I did what she said. I put the bar from my pocket back in the safe and replaced it with a different, identical one. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t show anybody,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t share it unless it&#x2019;s with someone you really love.&#x201d; Easier said than done, I thought, but I promised I wouldn&#x2019;t. I kissed my grandmother&#x2019;s papery cheek again. I closed the door softly behind me. I loved Nana, but I couldn&#x2019;t stand to be in that awful room. When I went back out to the living room, Gable wasn&#x2019;t there. I knew where he&#x2019;d be. Gable was lying in the middle of my bed, passed out. As I saw it, that was the problem with caffeine. A little of it, and you had a nice buzz. Too much, and you were a goner. At least, that&#x2019;s how it was for Gable. I kicked him, not too hard, on the leg. He didn&#x2019;t wake up. I kicked him again, harder. He grunted a little and rolled onto his back. I figured I&#x2019;d let him sleep it off. If worst came to worst, I&#x2019;d sleep on the couch. Anyway, Gable was cute when he slept. Harmless, like a puppy or a little boy. I suppose I liked him best that way. I took my school uniform from my closet and laid it out on my desk chair for the next day. I organized my bag and charged up my slate. I broke off a single piece of dark chocolate. The flavor was strong and woodsy. I rewrapped the rest in its silver foil and put it in my top drawer for safekeeping. I was glad I hadn&#x2019;t had to share it with Gable. You&#x2019;re probably asking why Gable was my boyfriend when I barely wanted to share chocolate with him. The thing is, he wasn&#x2019;t boring. He was a little dangerous and, stupid girl that I was, I guess I found that sort of thing attractive. And&#x2014;God rest your soul, Daddy&#x2014;it could be said that I lacked positive male role models. Besides, sharing chocolate wasn&#x2019;t some casual thing: it really was hard to come by. I decided to take a shower so I wouldn&#x2019;t have to do it in the morning. When I got out ninety seconds later (everyone&#x2019;s showers ran on timers because of how expensive water was getting), Gable was sitting cross-legged on my bed while stuffing the last of my chocolate bar down his throat. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said, my towel wrapped around me, &#x201c;you went into my drawer!&#x201d; Chocolate was smudged on his thumb, index finger, and the inside corners of his mouth. &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t snooping. I sniffed it out,&#x201d; he said in the middle of a bite. He paused chomping long enough to look up at me. &#x201c;You look pretty, Annie. Clean.&#x201d; I wrapped my towel tighter around myself. &#x201c;Well, now that you&#x2019;re awake and you&#x2019;ve had your chocolate, you should leave,&#x201d; I said. He didn&#x2019;t move. &#x201c;Come on, then! Out!&#x201d; I said this strongly, if not loudly. I didn&#x2019;t want to wake my siblings or Nana. That&#x2019;s when he told me that he thought we should have sex. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, wishing very much that I hadn&#x2019;t been so foolish as to take a shower while a dangerous, overcaffeinated boy lay in wait on my bed. &#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he asked. And then he said that he was in love with me. It was the first time a boy had ever told me that. Even as inexperienced as I was, I could tell he didn&#x2019;t mean it. &#x201c;I want you to go,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got school tomorrow, and we both should get some sleep.&#x201d; &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go now. It&#x2019;s past midnight.&#x201d; Not that there were enough cops to enforce it, but midnight was the citywide, under-eighteen curfew. It was only 11:45, so I lied and told him he could still make it if he ran. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never make it, Annie. Besides, my parents aren&#x2019;t home, and your grandma will never know if I stay. Come on, be sweet to me.&#x201d; I shook my head and tried to look tough, which was somewhat hard to do while wearing a yellow, flowered towel. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t it count for anything that I just told you I love you?&#x201d; Gable asked. I considered this briefly before deciding that it didn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Not really. Not when I know you don&#x2019;t mean it.&#x201d; He looked at me with big, dumb eyes like I had hurt his feelings or something. Then he cleared his throat and tried a different technique. &#x201c;Come on, Annie. We&#x2019;ve been together almost nine months. That&#x2019;s the longest I&#x2019;ve ever been with anyone. So &#x2026; Like &#x2026; Why not?&#x201d; I gave him my list. One, I said, we were too young. Two, I didn&#x2019;t love him. And three, the most important of all, I didn&#x2019;t believe in sex before marriage. I was a mostly good Catholic girl, and I knew exactly where the type of behavior he was suggesting would get me: straight to Hell. For the record, I very much believed (and believe) in Heaven and Hell, and not in an abstract way either. More about this later. His eyes were a little crazy&#x2014;maybe it was the contraband he&#x2019;d consumed&#x2014;and he got up from the bed and walked closer to me. He started tickling my bare arms. &#x201c;Stop that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Seriously, Gable, this isn&#x2019;t funny. I know you&#x2019;re trying to get me to drop my towel.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why&#x2019;d you take that shower if you didn&#x2019;t want&#x2014;&#x201d; I told him I&#x2019;d scream. &#x201c;And then what?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Your grandma can&#x2019;t get out of bed. Your brother&#x2019;s a retard. And your sister&#x2019;s just a kid. All you&#x2019;ll do is make them upset.&#x201d; Part of me couldn&#x2019;t believe this was actually happening in my own house. That I&#x2019;d allowed myself to be so witless and vulnerable. I hooked my towel under my armpits, and I pushed Gable away as hard as I could. <i>&#x201c;Leo is not a retard!&#x201d;</i> I yelled. I heard a door open at the end of the hallway and then, footsteps. Leo, who was tall like Daddy had been (six feet five inches), appeared in my doorway wearing pajamas with a pattern of dogs and bones on them. Even though I had been handling things, I had never been so happy to see my big brother. &#x201c;Hey, Annie!&#x201d; Leo wrapped me in a quick hug before turning to my soon-to-be ex-boyfriend. &#x201c;Hello, Gable,&#x201d; Leo said. &#x201c;I heard noise. I think you should leave now. You woke me which is okay. But if you wake Natty that won&#x2019;t be good because she has to go to school tomorrow.&#x201d; Leo led Gable to our front door. I didn&#x2019;t relax until I heard it shut and Leo had latched the chain. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think your boyfriend is very nice,&#x201d; Leo told me when he got back. &#x201c;You know what? I don&#x2019;t think so either,&#x201d; I said. I picked up Gable&#x2019;s discarded chocolate wrappers and crushed them into a ball. By Nana&#x2019;s standards, the only chocolate-worthy boy in my life was my brother. The first day of school stunk more than most first days of school, and they tend to stink as a rule. Everyone had already heard that Gable Arsley and Anya Balanchine were over. This was annoying. Not because I had had any intention of staying with him after the foul he&#x2019;d committed the night before, but because I&#x2019;d wanted to be the one to break up with him. I&#x2019;d wanted him to cry or yell or apologize. I&#x2019;d wanted to walk away and not look back as he called my name. That sort of thing, right? I have to admit: it was amazing how fast the rumors spread. Minors weren&#x2019;t allowed to have their own phones, and no one of any age could publish, virtually or otherwise, without a license or even send an e-mail without paying postage and yet gossip always finds a way. And a good lie travels a heck of a lot faster than the sad, boring truth. By third period, the story of my breakup had been carved in stone, and I hadn&#x2019;t been the one doing the carving. I skipped fourth period to go to confession. When I entered the confessional, I could see the distinctly female silhouette of Mother Piousina through the screen. Believe it or not, she was the first female priest Holy Trinity School had ever had. Even though these were supposedly modern times and everyone was supposedly enlightened, more than a few parents had complained when the Board of Overseers had announced her as their selection the prior year. There were some people who just weren&#x2019;t comfortable with the idea of a lady priest. In addition to being a Catholic school, HT was also one of the better schools in Manhattan. Parents who paid its exorbitant tuition did so with the understanding that the school wasn&#x2019;t allowed to change no matter how bad things got everywhere else. I kneeled down and crossed myself. &#x201c;Bless me, Mother, for I have sinned. It has been three months since my last confession &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s troubling you, daughter?&#x201d; I told her how I&#x2019;d been having impure thoughts about Gable Arsley all morning. I didn&#x2019;t use his name but Mother Piousina probably knew who I was talking about anyway. Everyone else at school did. &#x201c;Are you considering having intercourse with him?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Because action would be an even greater sin than the thoughts themselves.&#x201d; &#x201c;I know that, Mother,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nothing like that. The thing is, this boy&#x2019;s been spreading rumors about me, and I&#x2019;ve just been thinking how I hate him and I want to kill him or at least hurt him a little.&#x201d; Mother Piousina laughed in a way that only somewhat offended me. &#x201c;Is that everything?&#x201d; she asked. I told her that I&#x2019;d used the Lord&#x2019;s name in vain several times over the summer. Most of the instances had occurred during the mayor&#x2019;s Great Air-Conditioning Ration. One of our &#x201c;off days&#x201d; had coincided with the hottest day in August. Between the 110-degree temperature and the heat generated by Nana&#x2019;s many machines, the apartment had been a pretty close approximation of Hell. &#x201c;Anything else?&#x201d; &#x201c;One more thing. My grandmother is very sick and even though I love her&#x201d;&#x2014;this was really hard for me to say&#x2014;&#x201c;sometimes I wish she would just die already.&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to see her suffer. God understands that you don&#x2019;t mean it, my child.&#x201d; &#x201c;Sometimes I have bad thoughts about the dead,&#x201d; I added. &#x201c;Anyone specific?&#x201d; &#x201c;My father mainly. But my mother sometimes, too. And sometimes&#x2014;&#x201d; Mother Piousina interrupted. &#x201c;Perhaps three months is too long for you to go between confessions, daughter.&#x201d; She laughed again which annoyed me, but I continued anyway. The next one was the hardest to say. &#x201c;Sometimes I am ashamed of my older brother, Leo, because he&#x2019;s &#x2026; It&#x2019;s not his fault. He&#x2019;s the kindest, most loving brother but &#x2026; You probably know that he&#x2019;s a little slow. Today, he wanted to walk me and Natty to school but I told him that my grandmother needed him at home and that he&#x2019;d be late for his job. Both lies.&#x201d; &#x201c;Is this your entire confession?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, bowing my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry for these and all the sins of my past life.&#x201d; Then I prayed the Act of Contrition. &#x201c;I absolve you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,&#x201d; Mother Piousina said. She told me to say a Hail Mary and the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer as penance, which seemed a ridiculously minor punishment. Her predecessor, Father Xavier, really knew how to give a good penance. I stood. I was about to open the burgundy curtain when she called to me, &#x201c;Anya, light a candle for your mother and father in Heaven.&#x201d; She slid open the screen and handed me two candle vouchers. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to ration candles now,&#x201d; I grumbled. With the endless stupid coupons and stamps (weren&#x2019;t we supposed to be rationing paper?), the arbitrary point system, and the constantly changing rules, ration laws were incredibly annoying and impossible to keep up with. It was no wonder so many people bought goods on the black market. &#x201c;Look on the bright side. You can still have as much of the host as you want,&#x201d; Mother Piousina replied. I took the slips and thanked Mother Piousina. For all the good lighting candles would do, I thought bitterly. I was pretty sure my father was in Hell. After giving my vouchers to a nun with a wicker ticket basket and a box of votives, I went into the chapel and lit a candle for my mother. I prayed that, despite having married the head of the Bala...</p><h2>The Drone Pilot&#39;s Handbook: The knowledge, the skills, the rules</h2><p><br> Flying multicopter drones - quadcopters, hexacopters and others like them - is one of the fastest growing hobbies in the world, with millions now enjoying the challenges of unmanned flight. <br> Whether you've never flown before - or if you've already experienced the fun of a toy 'copter - this book is for you.

A descendant from a dynasty of merchant princes and a line of famous artists, he was a Jew turned Catholic, a husband and father who enjoyed close relationships with members of his own sex (Stephen Tennant among others). Celebrated as the author of some of the most moving war poems and of the &#34;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&#34;, Sassoon&#39;s inner feelings have nonetheless remained imprisoned in his diaries, only a proportion of which it has been deemed appropriate to publish thus far. With Wilfred Owen and Robert Graves, Sassoon struggled with his sexuality, a story he wanted to capture himself to bridge &#34;the raging (or lethargic) river of intolerance which divides creatures of my temperament from a free and unsecretive existence among their fellow men&#34;.

The manufacture of pottery has a history of over five thousand years in ancient Egypt. This book concentrates on that from the time of the first pharaohs, approximately 3000 BC, to the conquest by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Pottery was used for vessels that served a wide variety of functions, including everyday cooking and domestic purposes, storage of cosmetics and oils, storage and transport of food and drink, and use in temple and funerary rituals. While the majority of the pottery from ancient Egypt is plain and utilitarian, potters decorated vessels with elaborate designs incorporating a wide range of motifs and produced numerous types of &#39;fancy forms&#39; such as vessels in the form of humans, animals and birds. The Egyptian potters were highly skilled in their craft and made an enormous variety of vessels. Using information drawn from such diverse sources as tomb reliefs and inscriptions, as well as the large amount of pottery from pharaonic Egypt that survives today, this book examines the techniques of pottery manufacture, types of decoration and the function of pottery in that society. The historical development of Egyptian pottery is outlined and its role in Egyptology today is examined.</p><p>Colin A.

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel. <p>The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians. </p><p>The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. </p><p>After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, the a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. </p><p>In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Sone of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. </p><p>Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book." </p><p>In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as "The Testimony of Three Witnesses" and "The Testimony of Eight Witnesses." </p><p>We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and the to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost. (See Moroni 10:3-5.) </p><p>Those who gain this divine witness from the holy Spirit will also come to know by the same power that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that Joseph Smith is his revelator and prophet in these last days, and that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the Lord's kingdom once again established on the earth, preparatory to the second coming of the Messiah.</p></p><p>THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES: Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken. And we also know that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know of a surety that the work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man. And we declare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we beheld an! d bear record that these things are true. And it is marvelous in our eyes. Nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it; wherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and be found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honor be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen. <p>Oliver Cowdery<br> David Whitmer<br> Martin Harris </p><p>THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES: </p><p>Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it. </p><p>Christian Whitmer<br> Jacob Whitmer </p><p>Peter Whitmer, Jun.<br> John Whitmer<br> Hiram Page<br> Joseph Smith, Sen.<br> Hyrum Smith<br> Samuel H. Smith</p>Joseph Smith is not the author, per se, but rather the translator of the Book of Mormon. <p>Joseph Smith, Jr. (1805-1844), was the founding prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In the spring of 1820, when Joseph was 14 years-old, he was much disturbed by the competing claims of the ministers in the area, and frustrated that &#x201c;the teachers of religion....understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible. Upon reading James 1:5, &#x201c;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him,&#x201d; he determined to appeal to heaven for guidance. &#x201c;So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally. </p><p>&#x201c;After I had retired to the place where I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. </p><p>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction. </p><p>&#x201c;But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair...just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me. </p><p>&#x201c;It no soon appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spoke unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other &#x2013; This is My Beloved Son, Hear Him! </p><p>&#x201c;...No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself...than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right....and which I should join. I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong...&#x201d; </p><p>Joseph found that repeating the experience of this vision subjected him to persecution and ridicule. &#x201c;It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was than an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age....should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself....I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true...I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.&#x201d; </p><p>Several years later, in 1823 and at the age of 17, Joseph was visited by an angel, who told Joseph &#x201c;that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people. </p><p>&#x201c;He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the...fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it.&#x201d; </p><p>Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from the gold plates by the gift and power of God, translating the entire volume in approximately 60 working days. It was published in 1830 in Palmyra, New York. </p><p>Joseph Smith later wrote many additional revelations, founded several cities, including Nauvoo, the largest city in Illinois, and became one of the most controversial and celebrated personalities of the nineteenth century. Esteemed by his people as a holy prophet of God in the tradition of the Old and New Testaments, he was murdered by a mob at Carthage, Illinois, in 1844. He was 38.</p></p><h2>A bullet in the ballet</h2><p>Author Caryl Brahms was a major ballet critic before writing this satirical novel.

To nearly all the Chinese whom Kinkead meets in Chinatown, she is a low faan (``barbarian'')--``an object of fear, distrust, indifference.'' Yet, with the help of a Hong Kong-born translator, she slowly gains the confidence of waiters, shopkeepers, restaurateurs, healers, and so on, drawing on their stories, as well as on scholarly research, to piece together this personable look at ``the largest Chinese community in the Western hemisphere.'' No mean feat, that: typical is the author's exploration of a dark alley leading to a decrepit tenement where she meets a withered ancient who says that Kinkead is the first white person he's spoken to in 60 years in Chinatown. What keeps 150,000 Chinese in this isolated, crowded, crumbling ``slum''? Ironically, Kinkead finds, it's basically the urge to get out- -fulfilled through the single-minded accumulation of wealth. While Kinkead talks to men who work 80-hour weeks at menial jobs, live in dire poverty, and save a small fortune each year, her report makes it clear that the engine that drives Chinatown's economy is crime, festering in sweatshops and gambling halls, thriving on extortion and drug-dealing. Kinkead's too much of an outsider to penetrate the tongs and gangs that control Chinatown crime, but she offers comprehensive briefs on them, vivified by a tour of the mean streets with a veteran cop. But there's a gentler side, too, to Chinatown, and Kinkead covers that as well--family ties, festivals, Chinese medicine and cuisine, the tradition of concubinage, and the burgeoning urges to assimilate and to bring democracy to the Chinese mainland. Told in strong, clean prose: an exotic and fascinating journey by a modern-day, urban Marco Polo. (Eight pages of b&amp;w photographs- -not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Journalist Kinkead presents a stilted account that highlights the seamier side of New York City's Chinatown. She takes the reader on a rambling tour of gambling, drug lords, extortion, murder, racial hatred, and intergenerational clashes yet makes little attempt to cover any of the more positive and life-enhancing aspects of Chinese family support, religion, or education in this society. She also draws no conclusions about the society. This is mostly due to Kinkead's New Yorker style of anecdotal reporting; not surprising, since she is a frequent contributor to the magazine. This book is little more than an armchair Chinatown travelog, offering the excitement and titillation of foreign vice in an alien landscape. Kinkead is at least honest in making no pretense that this is a balanced, scholarly, sociological investigation. Optional.<br><i>- Glenn Masuchika, Chaminade Univ.

Enchanting author Sandra Austin takes gardeners beyond the common color wheel approach. Readers develop a comprehensive understanding of what color is, how it is perceived, how it affects perception and how it can be used to create beautiful gardens.<p>Suggests new ways to think about color, including a basic vocabulary that encourages the creative use of color in garden designs.<br>-- Includes new, fresh ways to use eye-catching color based on texture, light effects and creative imagination.<br>-- Explains basic color concepts as well as sophisticated color theory that will appeal to advanced gardeners.<br>-- Introduces modern color classification systems and explains how color families and combinations work together.<br>-- Contains brilliant full-color photos and extensive drawings and illustrations throughout.</p></p><p>Austin is a professional landscape designer and teacher."Color in Garden Design is not an easy book to read. Nor can you breeze through the photographs and pick up basic information about combining flower colors. Instead, Austin's approach to color is rigorous and professional; the book should be required reading for a complete course in garden design. If you are the kind of gardener who wants to know why, or if you are in the design profession, this book will bridge the gap between the purely scientific studies of color and the way color is used and responded to in the garden. Like serious gardeners who insist on Latin binomials for identification of plants, Austin pushes the reader to understand some of the technical language of color. <p>In her introduction, Austin says, "Perhaps the most exciting role of moire detailed and accurate color knowledge will be in spurring creativity. Many designers will be able to take the information in this book and look at their gardens in a new way, and create gardens that can't yet be imagined . . . color offers one possibility for organizing and discovering these new designs." -- <i>Ann Leyhe, <i>Horticulture</i></i><br><br>"For anyone very serious about color...This reflective book goes far beneath superficial color associations. This is not a book to skim. Her discussions on the role of background colors are a revelation." -- <i>Richard L.

The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.British novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, author of the acclaimed family-saga series, The Cazalet Chronicles, makes a successful stylistic departure in her new novel. This is a tale of romance told in the voices of two characters: Daisy Langrish, an emotionally vulnerable writer who buys a weekend cottage in the country, and Henry Kent, the charmer who offers to work in her garden. Both are over 60, and each wants something from the other. What they want and what they get--that's the crux of the story. The fine British actors Alan Bates and Diana Quick narrate the tale in alternating first-person chapters. The result is a pas de deux of nuanced, sympathetic reading. Henry Kent's charisma and Daisy's neediness are unforgettable. Neither Bates nor Quick attempts to create significantly different voices for the other characters who pass through the story, though Quick deepens her voice for one character, with mixed results. Instead the narrators create one true voice each for their own characters and capture the reader's imagination. A.C.S.

How did a single group from among many win the struggle for dominance to establish the beliefs central to the faith, rewrite the history of Christianity&#39;s internal conflicts, and produce a canon of sacred texts, the New Testament that supported its own views. These 24 lectures provide a fresh and provocative perspective on how a movement of perhaps only 20 lower-class followers of a Jewish apocalyptic preacher crucified as an enemy of the state grew to include nearly four million adherents in only 300 years. Professor Ehrman looks at the faith&#39;s beginnings, starting with the historical Jesus, Jewish-Christian relations, the way Paul and other Christians spread the new faith, hostility to the Christian mission, internal struggles within the faith, and the formation of traditional Christianity as we know it today. Christianity argued its ancient roots by retaining the Jewish scriptures and arguing that it was, in fact, the fulfillment of what those scriptures had promised. Throughout these lectures, Professor Ehrman challenges old misconceptions and offers fresh perspectives on aspects of Christianity and its roots that many of us might have thought we already understood. By offering you a scholar&#39;s perspective on the origins of what Professor Ehrman describes as the most important institution in Western civilization, this engaging course will increase your understanding of Christianity today.</p><p></p><h2>Caddie Woodlawn - Newbery Promo &#39;99 (Aladdin Fiction)</h2><p>Chronicles the adventures of eleven-year-old Caddie growing up with her six brothers and sisters on the Wisconsin frontier in the mid-nineteenth century.</p><p>At age 11, Caddie Woodlawn is the despair of her mother and the pride of her father: a clock-fixing tomboy running wild in the woods of Wisconsin. In 1864, this is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother's childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over 60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure: a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian friends of the white men's plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school house; and a letter from England that may change the family's life forever. This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie's irrepressible spirit. In spite of her mother's misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model for any girl--or boy, for that matter. She's big-hearted, she's brave, and she's mechanically inclined! <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i><i>Caddie Woodlawn</i>, which has been captivating young readers since 1935, was awarded the John Newbery Medal for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children. Now it is in a brand-new edition with lively illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. In her new foreword, Carol Ryrie Brink lovingly recalls the real Caddie, who was her grandmother, and tells how she often "sat spellbound, listening, listening!" as Caddie told stories of her pioneer childhood. Children everywhere will love redheaded Caddie with her penchant for pranks. Scarcely out of one scrape before she is into another, she refuses to be a "lady," preferring instead to run the woods with her brothers. Whether she is crossing the lake on a raft, visiting an Indian camp, or listening to the tales of the circuit rider, Caddie's adventures provide an exciting and authentic picture of life on the Wisconsin frontier in the 1860s. And readers will discover, as Caddie learns what growing up truly means, that it is not so very different today.

In this inspired exploration of the prophecy of Ezekiel, gospel authority Dr. Yong-In Spencer Shin delves into the scriptures to explain the similarities and differences between the Book of Mormon and the Bible with thoughtful clarity. Each chapter contains a wealth of information and explanation, with topics ranging from the true nature of deity to the ministry of Christ to sacred priesthood ordinances and covenants. By establishing the broad religious landscape and modern applicability of the Book of Mormon strengthened by the truths of the Bible, this volume stands as a powerful testament to the fact that the prophecies of old are truly being fulfilled in these latter days.</p></p><p></p><h2>India: Art and Culture, 1300-1900</h2><p>A history of the art and civilization of India includes discussions of sculpture, jewelry, painting, and illustrated manuscripts</p><p>Welch, a special consultant for the Metropolitan Museum's Department of Islamic Art, organized the Met's Festival of India exhibit, for which this splendid volume serves as the catalog.

Luke knew what grief was like....What if Oscar suddenly understood, too? <br> Smits's grief was dangerous. Smits's grief could kill Luke.</b> <br><br> As a third child in a society that allows only two children per family, Luke Garner was <b>in hiding</b> for the first twelve years of his life. Then he was <b>given the freedom</b> of an identity card that had belonged to Lee Grant, a Baron (a member of the highest class of society), and was sent to boarding school as Lee. But now, just when things are finally starting to go right, Lee's little brother, Smits, arrives at school, and Luke finds himself <b>caught in a web of lies</b> that gets more complex with every passing day -- and possibly even lethal. Can Luke trust the grief-stricken Smits to keep Luke's secret? And <b>can he trust</b> Smits's menacing bodyguard, Oscar? <br> Luke finds that living among the Barons puts him in the deadliest danger he has ever faced. <br> As she did in <b>Among the Hidden</b> and the other Shadow Children books, Margaret Peterson Haddix depicts one individual <b>trying to make sense</b> of a world in which nothing is what it seems.</p><p>Margaret Peterson Haddix is the author of many critically and popularly acclaimed YA and middle grade novels, including the Children of Exile series, The Missing series, the Under Their Skin series, and the Shadow Children series.

Mr. Hendricks wants to see you!"<br><br>Such a summons would have terrified Luke Garner only a few months earlier. When he'd first come to Hendricks School for Boys, the thought of having to talk to any grown-up, let alone the headmaster, would have turned him into a stammering, quaking fool desperately longing for a place to hide.<br><br>But that was back in April, and this was August. A lot had happened between April and August.<br><br>Now Luke just waved off the rising tide of "ooh's" from his friends in math class. <br><br>"What'd you do, L.? Have you been sneaking out to the woods again?" his friend John taunted him.<br><br>"Settle down, class," the teacher, Mr. Rees, said mildly. "You may be excused, Mr., uh, Mr...."<br><br>Luke didn't wait for Mr. Rees to try to remember his name. Names were slippery things at Hendricks School anyway. Luke, like all his friends, was registered under a different name from what he had grown up with. So it was always hard to know what to call people.<br><br>Luke edged his way past his classmates' desks and slipped out the door. His friend Trey, who had delivered the message from Mr. Hendricks, was waiting for him.<br><br>"What's this about?" Luke asked as the two fell into step together, walking down the hall.<br><br>"I don't know. I just do what he tells me," Trey said with a dispirited shrug.<br><br>Sometimes Luke wanted to take Trey by the shoulders, shake him, and yell, "Think for yourself! Open your eyes! Live a little!" Twelve years of hiding in a tiny room had turned Trey into a human turtle, always ready to pull back into his shell at the slightest hint of danger.<br><br>But Mr. Hendricks had taken a liking to Trey and was working with him privately. That was why Trey was running errands for him today.<br><br>Trey looked furtively over at Luke. His dark hair hung down into his eyes. "Do you suppose it's -- you know -- time?"<br><br>Luke didn't have to ask what Trey meant. Sometimes it seemed like everyone at Hendricks School was just holding his breath, waiting. Waiting for a day when none of the boys would be illegal anymore, when they could all reclaim their rightful names, when they could go back to their rightful families without fear that the Population Police would catch them. But both Luke and Trey knew that that day wouldn't come easily. And Luke, at least, had promised to do everything he could to bring it about.<br><br>His stomach churned. The fear he thought he'd outgrown reached him at last.<br><br>"Did he say...did Mr. Hendricks say...," he stammered. What if Mr. Hendricks had a plan for Luke to help with? What if that plan required more courage than Luke had?<br><br>Trey went back to looking down at the polished tile floor.<br><br>"Mr. Hendricks didn't say anything except, 'Go get your buddy L. out of math class and tell him to come see me,'" Trey said.<br><br>"Oh," Luke said.<br><br>They reached the end of the hall, and Luke pushed open the heavy wood door to the outside. Trey winced, as he always did anytime he was exposed to sunshine, fresh air, or anything else outdoors. But Luke breathed in gratefully. Luke had spent his first twelve years on his family's farm; some of his fondest memories involved the feeling of warm dirt on his bare feet, sunshine on the back of his neck, a hoe in his hand -- and his parents and brothers around him.<br><br>But it didn't do to think much about his parents and brothers anymore. When he'd accepted his fake identity, he'd had to leave them and the farm behind. And even when he'd been with them, he'd had to live like a shadow or a ghost, something no one else outside the family knew about.<br><br>Once when his middle brother, Mark, was in first grade, he'd accidentally slipped and mentioned Luke's name at school.<br><br>"I had to tell the teacher that Mark just had an imaginary friend named Luke," Luke's mother had told him. "But I worried about that for months afterward. I was so scared the teacher would report you, and the Population Police would come and take you away. I'm just glad that a lot of little kids do have imaginary friends."<br><br>She'd bitten her lip telling Luke that story. Luke could still see the strained expression on her face. She hadn't even told him about that episode until the day before he left the farm and his family for good. By then she'd meant the story as assurance, he knew -- assurance that he was doing the right thing by leaving.<br><br>At the time, Luke hadn't known what to make of that story. It just added to the jumble of confused thoughts and fears in his head. But now -- now that story made him angry. It wasn't fair that he'd had to be invisible. It wasn't fair that his brother couldn't talk about him. It wasn't fair that the Government had made him illegal simply because he was a third child and the Government thought families should have no more than two.<br><br>Luke stepped out into the sunshine feeling strangely happy to be so angry. It felt good to be so sure about what he thought, so totally convinced that he was right and the Government was wrong. And if Mr. Hendricks really did have a plan for Luke, it'd be good to hang on to this righteous anger.<br><br>The two boys climbed down an imposing number of marble steps. Luke noticed that Trey glanced back longingly at the school more than once. Not Luke. Hendricks had no windows -- to accommodate the fears of kids like Trey -- and Luke always felt slightly caged anytime he was inside.<br><br>They walked on down the lane to a house half hidden in bushes. Mr. Hendricks was waiting for them at the door.<br><br>"Come on in," he said heartily to Luke. "Trey, you can go on back to school and see about learning something for once." That was a joke -- Trey had done nothing but read while he'd been in hiding, so he knew as much about some subjects as the teachers did.<br><br>Luke opened the door, and Mr. Hendricks rolled back in his wheelchair to give Luke room to pass. When he'd first met Mr. Hendricks, Luke had been awkward around him, particularly because of the wheelchair. But now Luke practically forgot that Mr. Hendricks's lower legs were missing. Going into the living room, Luke automatically stepped out of the way of Mr. Hendricks's wheels.<br><br>"The other boys will find this out soon enough," Mr. Hendricks said. "But I wanted to tell you first, to give you time to adjust."<br><br>"Adjust to what?" Luke asked, sitting down on a couch.<br><br>"Having your brother here at school with you."<br><br>"My brother?" Luke repeated. "You mean Matthew or Mark..." He tried to picture either of his rough, wild older brothers in their faded jeans and flannel shirts walking up the marble stairs at Hendricks. If he felt caged at the windowless school, his brothers would feel handcuffed, pinned down, thoroughly imprisoned. And how could Mother and Dad possibly afford to send them here? Why would they want to?<br><br>"No, <i>Lee,"</i> Mr. Hendricks said, stressing the fake name that Luke had adopted when he'd come out of hiding. Luke knew that he should be grateful that the parents of a boy named Lee Grant had donated his name and identity after the real Lee died in a skiing accident. The Grants were Barons -- really rich people -- so Luke's new identity was an impressive one indeed. But Luke didn't like to be called Lee, didn't like even to be reminded that he was supposed to be somebody else.<br><br>Mr. Hendricks was peering straight at Luke, waiting for Luke to catch on.<br><br>"I said your brother," Mr. Hendricks repeated. "Smithfield William Grant. <i>You</i> call him Smits. And he's coming here tomorrow."<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by Margaret Peterson Haddix</p><h2>Emily Post&#39;s The Guide to Good Manners for Kids</h2><p><p>Since 1922, the name Emily Post has represented good manners based on kindness, courtesy, and unselfishness.

Peggy writes a monthly column in <em>Good Housekeeping</em> and an online wedding etiquette column for the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>Grade 3-7&#x2013;Post and Senning pinpoint the three main factors in etiquette as respect, consideration, and honesty. The book begins with a chapter on everyday life, which consists of thank yous and other written and spoken words, privacy, greetings and introductions, and techno-manners. The treatment of chat rooms, message boards, e-mail, pagers, and computers offers guidelines that protect users while facilitating positive, healthy interactions. Subsequent chapters take on family relations within the home, situations at school, social events, manners at the mall and concerts, hospital visits, religious events and weddings, and travel. Eating out, whether fast food or fine dining, is covered, as are funerals, taxis, and interacting with a person with a disability. The writing is clear, friendly, and sometimes clever, putting readers at ease and raising myriad possibilities through the use of "what if" scenarios, complete with possible dialogue and even multiple-choice answers. Lists of "Always and Nevers" provide quick reference for things like taking messages, making introductions, and borrowing personal items. "Sticky Situations" offers solutions to avoid embarrassment. The advice is consistently practical and simple, and is addressed to boys as well as girls ("Always put the toilet seat down"). Divorce or remarriage is treated compassionately, with specific suggestions for reacting honestly and considerately toward all parties.

This may easily be true--it is incredibly, insanely detailed. Author Adam Victor has taken every conceivable source of Marilyn information--admittedly including Internet rumors and Hollywood gossip among the more well-documented tidbits--distilled them down to alphabetical entries, and cross-referenced them to within an inch of their lives. While the casual fan can check out Marilyn's <i>Look</i> covers or a list of the screenwriters she worked with, hardcore devotees can look up such vital information as the name of the first restaurant she and Joe DiMaggio ate at on their honeymoon (a controversy--was it the restaurant at the Hot Springs Hotel or at the Clifton Inn?) or the name of Marilyn's poodle (Maf Honey). The meticulous cross-referencing makes <i>The Marilyn Encyclopedia</i> an extremely enjoyable browser's read, allowing the reader to hop from Marilyn's disdain for underwear to her working relationship with John Huston to the fact that she never had much trouble with gambling--all with the flip of a page. This encyclopedia of course contains a rich assortment of photos: posed studio portraits, pinups, and candid shots vie for space throughout the tome. Despite his obvious devotion as a fan, Victor is remarkably evenhanded in his choice of the quotes and anecdotes sprinkled throughout the book. The reader cannot help but be left with the impression that, for all her magical appeal, Monroe may well have been a trying person to deal with on a day-to-day basis. This is the perfect book for the dedicated fan who wants to know everything--no, really, everything--about Marilyn Monroe. <i>--Ali Davis</i>Adam Victor is a writer and translator.

Five hundred poems, selected by poet and anthologist Jack Prelutsky, are divided into broad subject areas such as nature, seasons, living things, children, and home. The poems of Emily Dickinson, Robert Louis Stevenson, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Nikki Giovanni, and Gwendolyn Brooks populate the book&#39;s pages, while Lewis Carroll, Edward Lear, Ogden Nash, and Shel Silverstein ensure that the collection delights even the most reluctant readers of rhyme. Playground chants, anonymous rhymes, scary poems, silly verse, and even some sad strains are carefully indexed by title, author, first line, and subject. With illustrations of cheerful, round-faced children and animals on every page, Arnold Lobel (a Caldecott medalist and creator of the Frog and Toad series) unifies the diverse poems to form a satisfying whole; Lobel can draw anything and make it funny--or poignant, if he chooses. This collection, one of the most varied and complete around, will carry any budding poetry lover through childhood and beyond.

Several books have previously been published on Charles Ng. None contains the full story, and none draws on sources so extensive nor provides a portrait so penetrating of the dark mind of a sociopathic killer.</p><p>� Readers will learn for the first time about the extensive involvement of a Lt. Columbo-like Mountie and a small-time Saskatchewan hood turned kidnapper-robber and how they were instrumental in bringing Ng to justice for a dozen murders. They will learn for the first time of Ng&#x2019;s attempted suicide immediately after his arrest in Calgary, Canada. <p>� The Ng case forced the Canadian courts to examine for the first time the issue of capital punishment in light of the patriation of the Canadian Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </p><p>� At one point, exasperated senior American officials went so far as to threaten to come into Canada and forcibly take Ng if the Canadian courts refused to give him up to face California&#x2019;s death penalty. </p><p>� In painting their profile of Ng, the authors reached far into his past to interview former classmates in private schools in Hong Kong and Britain. They also sought the help of a leading expert on psychopathic killers to examine Ng&#x2019;s upbringing and its impact on his development. His conclusion: Ng may have been &#x201c;hard-wired&#x201d; to kill. </p><p>� In researching No Kill No Thrill, the authors spent hundreds of hours interviewing police and court officials and going through reams of case files. They traveled to California several times to attend Ng&#x2019;s sentencing in Santa Ana, to meet family members of victims in Garden Grove and San Francisco and to visit the murder scene in Wilseyville. </p><p>� To prepare the final chapter, they attended a private service for the victims in San Andreas, standing alongside members of the victims&#x2019; families at a cairn containing the unidentified remains of as many as 25 people.</p>"No kill, no thrill," Charles Ng loved to say, followed by, "No gun, no fun." In a remote corner of the Sierra Nevada foothills of Northern California, Charles Ng hatched a nightmarish scheme of kidnapping and murder with another ex-marine survivalist, Leonard Lake. They dubbed their plan the Miranda project, after the female protagonist in the John Fowles novel The Collector. Husbands and children were murdered immediately. Women were kept alive as sex slaves for as long as they held the interest of their captors. <p>Ng and Lake killed at least a dozen men, women and children, and perhaps as many as twenty-five. When the Miranda project finally threatened to collapse as the two were arrested on unrelated charges, Lake took a lethal cyanide pill and Ng fled to Canada. There he was arrested for robbery and the shooting of a department store security guard. </p><p>Then, for Canadian police, two critical events established a surprising link between the robber being held in an Alberta prison and the cold-blooded murderer wanted thousands of miles away. The first was that Ng told some of his story to fellow prisoner Maurice Laberge. Laberge recognized Ng&#x2019;s story as a ticket to early parole and encouraged Ng to tell more. Ng obliged--not only with words but with grizzly cartoons of his psychopathic desires. The second event was that Laberge connected with RCMP Sgt. Raymond Munro, who, in cooperation with California police, began investigating the relationship between Ng and the Northern California murders. </p><p>As Ng fought extradition to the United States for six years, Sgt. Munro became involved in one of the longest, most intricate and most expensive international investigations and subsequent trials to have ever occurred in North America. </p><p>No Kill, No Thrill is the story of a cop, a killer and his confidante. But more, it is the story of dogged, resourceful police work that brought a killer to justice. Drawing frequently upon little-known sources ranging from Charles Ng&#x2019;s childhood in Hong Kong, his experience in the U.S. marines and his heinous killing spree, No Kill, No Thrill is a penetrating portrait of the dark mind of a sociopathic killer who now awaits execution on death row.</p></p><h2>Homeboy</h2><p>Even behind bars, Joe Speaker, an addict, is not safe from the killers who want the Jager Moon, a large blue diamond, and who, with the help of corrupt prison guards, are determined to get it back, no matter what the cost</p><p>Seth Morgan (1949&#x2013;1990) was an American novelist whose sole published title, <i>Homeboy</i>, received much critical acclaim. Morgan drew from his own experiences with San Francisco drug culture and prison in order to write what the <i>New York Times</i> called &#x201c;an unnerving and utterly persuasive rendition of hell.&#x201d;<br><br> As a young boy, Morgan attended many elite private schools, including St. Bernard&#x2019;s School in New York and the American School in Switzerland. He also briefly attended the University of California, Berkeley, before dropping out and moving in with singer Janis Joplin. They became engaged shortly before she died. At the time of his own death in a motorcycle accident, Morgan was under contract for a second novel, set in New Orleans and titled&nbsp;<i>Mambo Mephiste</i>.When Joe Speaker, barker for a San Francisco strip joint, pulls off a caper inadvertently involving a precious diamond necklace, he incurs the wrath of porno king Baby Jewels and the interest of Detective Tarzon. Joe is sent to prison, where he breaks a drug habit and survives by his wits. Meanwhile, on the outside, Baby Jewels is maneuvering; Joe's girl friend is shacked up and pregnant; and various people are plotting, acting, and reacting. There is a dazzling vitality to this first novel. The language is raw; the characters are fresh and outrageous; the style is wicked and impudent. And in the dramatization of good versus evil (and the difficulty of sometimes telling the difference), the author succeeds in providing substance. Though not for readers looking for a standard thriller, this offbeat novel is outstanding and certain to be talked about. (Note: The title refers to prison slang for buddy. )-- Robert E.

The authors begin the volume by charting out a serviceable definition of ecumenism, a term that has long been a source of confusion for students of theology and church history. They review the chronology of the modern ecumenical movement and highlight the major events, figures, accomplishments, and impasses. This historical survey is followed by critical examinations of three significant challenges for contemporary ecumenical theology and practice. Along the way, the authors provide commentary upon the difficulties and prospects that the ecumenical movement might anticipate as it enters this new millennium.</p><p><p><b>R.

The result is a broad, yet theologically astute orientation to ecumenism. Particularly noteworthy is the claim that contemporary ecumenism is unintelligible apart from the contributions of evangelical Christianity. Nelson and Raith's passion for the church's unity will draw in many of those skeptical of ecumenism." - <i>Hans Boersma, Regent College, Canada</i></p><p>"Nelson and Raith here offer a perceptive and penetrating analysis of the history, accomplishments, and difficulties attending the ecumenical movement. In briskly written chapters, entirely suitable for students, they summarize the debates over "basic theological difference", over the ongoing reception of agreements, and over the ultimate goal of ecumenical dialogue. This volume is an exceedingly useful and deeply significant milestone in contemporary ecumenical studies." - <i>Thomas G. Guarino, Seton Hall University, USA</i></p><p>"This volume is a work of penitence. Recognizing the disjunction between Jesus' prayer for unity and the indifference among contemporary Christians over the fragmented state of the church, Nelson and Raith come to us not as dispassionate commentators or naive idealists; they are personal guides on an honest journey toward ecclesial unity. Erudite and warmhearted, they explain why ecumenism is an imperative for all Christians in whom the Spirit dwells." - <i>Chris Cataldo, New Covenant Church, Naperville, USA</i></p><p>"As a Catholic theologian, I know that I cannot do justice to any doctrinal topic without carefully reading and learning from what Orthodox and Protestant Christians teach about it - but before reading this book I doubted that anyone needed a book on the ecumenical movement itself. Nelson and Raith's eloquent and incisive book has completely converted me. One finds here not only a short masterwork of historical theology, but also a properly theological approach to measuring the history and purposes of the past century of Christian ecumenism, attentive to important areas of difference and agreement alike. This jewel of a book is an extraordinary resource for all Christians who today hear the Spirit's urgent call to draw near to each other in Christ." - <i>Matthew Levering, Mundelein Seminary, USA</i></p></p><h2>Europe Grandeur And Decline</h2><p>Physical description: 378 p.

Conscription was mandatory for nearly all male Prussian citizens, and the willingness to fight and die for country was essential to the ideals of a developing German national identity. In this engaging historical narrative, Mark Jantzen describes the policies of the Prussian federal and regional governments toward the Mennonites over a hundred-year period and the legal, economic, and social pressures brought to bear on the Mennonites to conform. Mennonite leaders defended the exemptions of their communities' sons through a long history of petitions and legal pleas, and sought alternative ways, such as charitable donations, to support the state and prove their loyalty. Faced with increasingly punitive legal and financial restrictions, as well as widespread social disapproval, many Mennonites ultimately emigrated, and many others chose to join the German nation at the cost of their religious tradition. Jantzen tells the history of the Mennonite experience in Prussian territories against the backdrop of larger themes of Prussian state-building and the growth of German nationalism. The Mennonites, who lived on the margins of German society, were also active agents in the long struggle of the state to integrate them. The public debates over their place in Prussian society shed light on a multi-confessional German past and on the dissemination of nationalist values.</p><p>Mark Jantzen is associate professor of history at Bethel College, North Newton, Kansas. He is coeditor, with John D. Thiesen, of The Danzig Mennonite Church: Its Origin and History, 1569&#x2013;1919.&#x201c;Jantzen emphasizes not only church and state dynamics but also tensions within the governing party, as well as those within the Mennonite community. The state increased its impact as the population became increasingly nationalistic. Jantzen also observes how theological developments among German Protestants influenced Mennonite pastors and thought leaders. Jantzen portrays an evolving Mennonite identity over a hundred-year period. His book makes a significant contribution to understanding the richness, diversity, and struggle in the Mennonite story.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mennonite Weekly Review</i> (<i>Mennonite Weekly Review</i>)</p><h2>California Real Estate Law 9th Edition</h2><p>This book covers all material in Real Estate Law classes with special emphasis on California real estate procedures.

Could there be truth to the often-dismissed concept of conspiracy in history&#x2015;the manipulation of external events by groups and individuals mostly hidden from the public eye? <br><br>In the work of Rudolf Steiner, Boardman finds convincing evidence of the existence of secretive circles in the West that have plans for humanity&#x2019;s long-term future. Steiner indicated that such &#x201c;brotherhoods&#x201d; had prepared for world war in the twentieth century and instructed their members, using redrawn maps as a guide, on how Europe should be changed. <br><br>If such brotherhoods existed in Steiner&#x2019;s time, might not they still be active today? Based on detailed research, Boardman concludes that such groups are indeed directing world politics today. To back up his theory, he studies a series of important articles and maps&#x2015;from an 1890 edition of the satirical journal <i>Truth</i> to more recent pieces from influential publications that speak for themselves. He concludes that vast plans are in progress for a &#x201c;new world order&#x201d; to control and direct individuals and nations.

But the same studios and actors reject hundreds of romantic comedies a month. Mernit should know. As a story analyst who has read nearly 4,000 screenplays in the last 10 years, Mernit has seen the good, yes, but also too much of the bad and the ugly. With <i>Writing the Romantic Comedy</i>, Mernit presents his UCLA Extension rom-com writing workshop in book form. Believe it or not, it's not enough to have Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play the leads. You actually have to create characters for them--characters that an audience will believe "absolutely <i>must</i> end up together." Mernit manages to lay down ground rules without seeming rigid: "he can't be in it only for the sex"; "she can't be in it only for the money"; "at least one scene or sequence [should be] laugh-out-loud funny." Mernit offers five ways to bring your characters to life and seven basic romantic comedy "beats." He has chapters on chemistry, humor, dialogue, and sex ("in romantic comedy, there's nothing sexier than <i>sublimated</i> sex"), and he draws generously upon the surprisingly small canon of great romantic comedies to demonstrate his points.

J. Charles reads at a brisk pace, making an admirable attempt to inject tension and excitement where the writing fails to do so. There are many voices, and for the most part the accents are good, making the frequent scene and character changes easy to follow. There's lots of joking by Dean's team, giving a lighthearted tone to the proceedings. But both the excessive humor and the absence of characters to care about add up to a mediocre listening experience.

Many poems issue from a space of Wonderland-like decadence, where "tiny tin gutters would be gauche,/ pathetically mimetic" and "irritated he would play with his/ Chameleon putting her on a paisley pillow or tartan/ Scarf." There is a foreboding to such scenes, and a toughness to Harvey's speakers: one "can't be coy after all I've done" and another has "killed one pride only to have another replace it." Pervasive longings are often compressed into a verbal device Harvey may have imported from Turkish poetry, in which the start of a line (here always unpunctuated) is at once the end of one sentence and the start of the next: "this village is closer to the glacier than/ The volcano emits a tiny rumble &amp; drools lava every few/ Years go by..." It's used too often, but the people and pursuits within the poems as a whole certainly vary: a male poet proceeds from the "Vestibulum" to the "Frigidarium" to find his muse within domestic "Thermae"; "Frederick Courtney Selous" exhorts a lover to make a necklace of the stamps from his letters; one poor lover of the title poem casts a bathtub for his beloved only to burn his feetAall with the craft and care of miniature portraiture. While the results, despite watchful self-inoculation, can be precious, the imagination and syntactic dexterity they display are remarkable. (Nov.) <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.In Harvey's intensely visual d�but collection of poems, a painter says of his self-portrait, "It was bigger than me. The perspective was not mine." Throughout, we meet artists and eccentrics obsessed with the reflections they cast, often shaping the world to match their private illusions: a gardener "crows with / delight" as his sugar maple takes the form of a rooster; a woman paints her baseboards the color of her dachshund. Mournfully comic and syntactically inventive, Harvey's poems are both pleas for attentiveness ("Amaze me with / what you know. Do the barnacles really look / like ancient daisies, did the starfish really / turn orange &amp; purple from holding on?") and elegies for the images we try, but fail, to capture. <br> Copyright � 2005 <i>The New Yorker</i></p><h2>King Solomon&#39;s Temple: A Study of its Symbolism</h2><p><b>Author: E. Raymond Capt<br><strong>This study will not only lead you to the "Lord of the Temple" but will reveal a truth hidden by the Almighty for illumination in this present day.</strong></b><strong><br>The Temple of Solomon known as the House of God was in some respects the most wonderful building constructed by human craft. The biblical reference of the Temple conveys to the reader it's grandeur and holiness but reveals so few details that little hope was held of ever producing an accurate reconstruction.<br>Many attempts in the past to reconstruct the Temple have produced a wide variety of sketches and plans some of them fantastically imaginative.<br>Modern archaeologist seeking to shed light on the Bible's most famous building have dug amid the ancient masonry of Mt. Moriah or Temple Hill in Jerusalem and searched for parallels and origins in contemporary buildings in Egypt Mesopotamia and Phoenicia.<br>Their discoveries have revealed the architectural skill and building power of Solomon and his successors. Not only has the accuracy of the sacred scriptures been confirmed but we can more vividly visualize the buildings decorations and furnishings of the temple.<br>Today a visitor to Jerusalem can see the very stones placed in position by the masons of Solomon. He can explore the ingenious system by which water was brought to the Temple Hill and stored there. He can enter the great cavern under the old city now known with some justification as Solomon's Quarries where the famous white limestone that formed the basic building material of the Temple was cut and finished by Phoenician craftsman.<br>In recent years several conceptions of Solomon's Temple have been published. The Howland-Garber model a work incorporating most recent discoveries is in the opinion of the author the most realistic presentation to date. Linear illustrations of this reconstruction are shown in this work.<br>It is the author's hope that through this brief study of the Temple the reader will have a better understanding of it's spiritual meaning.<br><br>Paperback<br>96 pages</strong></p><p>E. Raymond Capt, M.A., A.I.A., F.S.A., Scot.At first glance, one might think E. Raymond Capt must be an ordained minister. He quotes chapters and verses from the Scriptures and tells about Bible characters in a flowing narrative which would credit any pulpit. What he&#39;s been, for over forty years, though, is a practicing archaeologist - not always digging to unearth ancient remains, but in recent years, sifting through known archaeological findings to shed new light on the history of the Bible.Capt holds a Master of Arts degree in Christian History and Biblical Archaeology from Covenant College, Lake Wales, Florida, and California State teaching credentials in Biblical Archaeology and History. He is also a member of the Archaeological Institute of America. In addition to writing, Capt has produced and presents slide and film lectures on Biblical Archaeology. These have been enjoyed by clubs, churches, and schools in many states and in Great Britain.In 1972, Capt was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and in 1976 received an honorary Doctorate of Literature (Doctor Literarum Honoris Causa) from the Accademia Testina Per Le Scienze, (established A.D. 450) Pescara, Italy.</p><h2>Monsieur Pamplemousse Takes the Cure: A Gastronomic Mystery</h2><p>Aristede Pamplemouse, undercover inspector for a prestigious food directory, and his bloodhound companion, Pommes Frites, investigate shady goings-on at a popular health farm called Chateau Morgue</p><p>Farfetched and frothy, this fourth in the detective series featuring Aristide Pamplemousse finds the corpulent Surete officer turned gastronomic investigator for Le Guide disguised as a blind man at Chateau Morgue, a health spa near the Pyrenees. Pamplemousse despairs of satisfied appetites for a fortnight, but his bloodhound Pommes Frites discovers kilos of sausage, and then Aristide himself discovers an affectionate English manicurist. While it becomes apparent that the regime at the spa covers some other activities, including murder and blackmail, not until the inspector rigs up a flying camera, utilizing helium and Pommes Frites's inflatable kennel hung with black silk lingerie, is the mystery of Chateau Morgue resolved. Though readers may have trouble following Pamplemousse's intricate thought processes and understanding exactly what was going on at Chateau Morgue, Pamplemousse and his faithful hound are an appealing pair and offer an evening of civilized entertainment.

Nothing much has changed in the dollhouse during that time, except for the fact that 45 years ago, Annabelle's Auntie Sarah disappeared from the dollhouse without a trace. After all this time, restless Annabelle is becoming more and more curious about her aunt's fate. And when she discovers Auntie Sarah's old diary, she becomes positively driven. Her cautious family tries to discourage her, but Annabelle won't be stopped, even though she risks Permanent Doll State, in which she could turn into a regular, nonliving doll. And when the "Real Pink Plastic" Funcraft family moves in next door, the Doll family's world is turned upside down--in more ways than one!<p> Fans of <i>The Borrowers</i> and <i>Stuart Little</i> will love this exciting story of adventure and mystery. The relationship between the two doll families, one antique, one modern, is hilariously, wonderfully drawn. The Funcrafts are reckless and raucous, with fearlessness born of their unbreakable plastic parts. The Doll family is reserved and somewhat prim, even though they occasionally break into '60s tunes like "Respect" in their sing-alongs. Annabelle is a heroine with integrity and gumption.

Finally, when she speaks, they answer back, telling their stories in a remarkable chorus of regrets, explanations, and insights. But the infant Marcus, son of the town's mayor, died before he learned to speak and can only wail away the hours. The roots of his anguish are revealed in a crescendo of lasting resonance that ties together the outcast Finch, her dead friends, and the living community outside the cemetery's gates.<br><br>With prose that is spare, yet richly poetic, Sheri Reynolds creates a vision of a world that is at once fantastic and palpably real.

Tamara Chalabi has the stuff, in every sense, that is needful to undertake this.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christopher Hitchens<br><br>In the tradition of Jung Chang&#x2019;s <em>Wild Swans </em>and Bhutto Benazir&#x2019;s <em>Reconciliation</em> comes Tamara Chalabi&#x2019;s unique memoir of returning to her family&#x2019;s homeland, Iraq. In this epic story of one daughter&#x2019;s journey through the annals of her family&#x2019;s tumultuous history, Chalabi&#x2019;s powerful voice and piercing vision illuminate her country and its people as never before.<br></p><p><p>For Tamara Chalabi, Iraq is more than a country of war and controversy; it is a place of poignant memory. For much of the twentieth century, the Chalabis were among the most influential families in Iraq. In the 1920s they were at the forefront of their country's awakening to modernity, and they played an integral part in the establishment of its monarchy. As courtiers, politicians, businessmen, rebels, merchants, and scholars, the Chalabis enjoyed vast privilege until the end of the 1950s, when they were forced to flee to the land of exile, myth, and imagination, where their beloved homeland took on the quality of a phantom country. In between came rebellions, foreign interventions, and the transformative development of oil wealth.</p><p>But in 2003, after a lifetime of exile, Tamara arrived in Baghdad just ten days after the city's fall, in the company of her father, Ahmad Chalabi, a leading opposition figure against the Saddam regime. <em>Late for Tea at the Deer Palace</em> chronicles a daughter's return to a homeland she'd known only through stories and her own imagination. As she investigates four generations of her family's history, Tamara offers a rich portrait of Middle Eastern family life and a provocative look at a lost Iraq. The story is populated by an array of unforgettable characters, among them Tamara's great-grandfather Abdul Hussein Chalabi, who as a member of the Ottoman parliament witnessed the end of the empire in Baghdad and the birth of the modern Iraqi state at the hands of the British; her grandfather Abdul Hadi Chalabi, who became one of the wealthiest men in Iraq and had strong ties with the British during World War II; and her grandmother Bibi, a grande dame who presided over Iraq's social and political life during Baghdad's 1920s and '30s heyday as the Paris of the Middle East.</p><p>At once intimate and magisterial, <em>Late for Tea at the Deer Palace</em> vividly captures the rich, overlooked history of a country that has been uprooted by war and a family that has persevered by never forgetting its dreams or its past.</p><p>Tamara Chalabi holds a PhD in history from Harvard University. She has written for <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The New Republic</em>, <em>Slate</em>, and <em>The Sunday Times</em>, among other publications. </p></p><h2>Christo and Jeanne-Claude in the Vogel Collection</h2><p>Christo and Jeanne-Claude have created some of the most visually breathtaking works of the twentieth century. From early wrapped objects to monumental outdoor projects such as The Umbrellas, Japan-U.S.A., 1984-91 and Wrapped Reichstag, Berlin, 1971-95, the artists have used fabric - wrapped, draped, and folded over, around, and through natural and constructed forms - to transcend the traditional bounds of painting, drawing, sculpture, and architecture.<br>This volume spanning forty years of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's remarkable career accompanies an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art of sixty-one works from the collection of Dorothy and Herbert Voqel, whose relationship with the artists dates to 1971. The wonderful breadth of works presented in color and discussed here includes several early packages, models for large-scale public works, preparatory drawings and collages for projects in urban and rural sites, and photographs of the completed projects.</p><p>Molly Donovan is assistant curator of modern and contemporary art at the National Gallery of Art.The true nature of the artistic partnership behind the remarkable environmental art works credited solely to Christo until 1994 is dramatically parsed in Burt Chernow's excellent dual biography, <i>Christo and Jeanne-Claude</i> [BKL F 15 02], and now Donovan, a curator at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., provides a handsomely illustrated volume that documents and interprets the unprecedented achievements of this immensely creative and adventurous duo. The galvanizing private collection of Dorothy and Herbert Vogel (now part of the National Gallery of Art) is the book's wellspring, an extensive gathering of more than 30 years' worth of vibrant drawings and prismatic photographs that document the Christo team's spectacular and provocative projects. The first colorplate is a shimmering close-up of the fabric used to make the glorious <i>Valley Curtain</i>, constructed in Colorado in 1971-72. This launches a series of high-resolution swathes of various "wrapping" fabrics that effectively punctuates this altogether vivid mix of art and biographical and aesthetic discussion, which includes a scintillating interview with the already legendary Christo and Jeanne-Claude. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While science offers a wealth of rational explanations for natural phenomena, we often prefer to embrace the fantasies that reassured our distant ancestors. And we&#39;ll even go to war to protect our delusions against those who do not share them.These are examples of what evolutionary psychologist Hank Davis calls &#34;Caveman Logic.&#34; Although some examples are funny, the condition itself is no laughing matter. In this engagingly written book, Davis encourages us to transcend the mental default settings and tribal loyalties that worked well for our ancestors back in the Pleistocene age. Davis laments a modern world in which more people believe in ESP, ghosts, and angels than in evolution. Superstition and religion get particularly critical treatment, although Davis argues that religion, itself, is not the problem but &#34;an inevitable by-product of how our minds misperform.&#34;Davis argues, &#34;It&#39;s time to move beyond the one-size-fits-all, safety and comfort-oriented settings that got our ancestors through the terrifying Pleistocene night.&#34; In contrast, Davis advocates a world in which &#34;spirituality&#34; is viewed as a dangerous rather than an admirable quality, and suggests ways in which we can overcome our innate predisposition toward irrationality. He concludes by pointing out that &#34;biology is not destiny.&#34; Just as some of us succeed in watching our diets, resisting violent impulses, and engaging in unselfish behavior, we can learn to use critical thinking and the insights of science to guide individual effort and social action in the service of our whole species.</p><p>Hank Davis (Guelph, Ontario, Canada) is an award-winning professor of psychology who teaches at the University of Guelph. He is the author of several books on behavioral science and popular culture and more than one hundred scientific papers."What was good enough 200,000 years ago no longer works very well. Davis makes his case with illuminating examples from everyday life. <i>Caveman Logic</i> is written with wit, humor and compassion. <b>A must-read</b> for those searching beyond superstition and fear to understand our place in the universe." --<b>Prof. Harry M.B. Hurwitz</b>, Director, The Lessing Institute<br><br>"Hank Davis does a terrific job in helping readers understand how ways of thinking that were both reasonable and advantageous in caveman days become illogical - and potentially destructive - when they are overextended to modern times. <b>A stimulating, thought-provoking book!</b>" --<b>Madeleine Van Hecke</b>, author of <i>Blind Spots: Why Smart People Do Dumb Things</i><br><br>"Why do we humans suffer from delusions such as those of religion? Davis gives <b>the best explanation yet</b>. Our brains are still the same as our Pleistocene ancestors whose survival was enhanced by seeing dangers even when they were none there. By critical thinking we can rid ourselves of these no longer needed survival tools." --<b>Victor J.

It did not do that, of course. Its literary, philosophical, and theological presuppositions, as Glenn Arbery points out in his new introduction, were too different from those of the ruling theoretical paradigms for it to be given a hearing And that is precisely what makes it a volume worth returning to. In Christ and Apollo, William Lynch examines the Greek dramatists, Dante, Shakespeare, Proust, Camus, Graham Greene, and other writers in light of their affinities with two opposing tendencies. The symbol of the first approach is Apollo. For Lynch, this is the tendency to want to escape the finite, real world and the human condition of embodiment: it has much in common with what critic Allen Tate called the angelic imagination. The symbol of the other tendency is Christ, the Word made flesh. Artists working in this tradition give readers a glimpse of the infinite by working patiently and honestly with the materials of the finite world, in all its messy imprecision. For Lynch, then, as Arbery points out, limitation, or finitude, is the great human good. Praised by Flannery O&#39;Connor, among others, Lynch&#39;s sophisticated work is in many ways an important elaboration of the New Criticism, avoiding that school of thought&#39;s formalist excesses while providing it with firmer philosophical ground. For anyone interested in understanding what distinguishes great literature, Christ and Apollo is an essential text.</p><p>William F. Lynch, S.J. (1908-1987) was born and educated in New York City, taking his doctorate from Fordham University in 1942 and later teaching at Georgetown University. In the early 1950s he became the editor of Thought, a leading Catholic journal of the time. Besides Christ and Apollo, Lynch&#39;s works of philosophy and criticism include The Image Industries, The Integrated Mind, and Christ and Prometheus.&#34;Theologian Lynch, in short, is an existentialist. But existence does not lead him, like Sartre, to nausea, but, like David, to dance before the ark.&#34;</p><h2>The Very Stuff: Poems on Color, Thread, and the Habits of Women</h2><p>A collection of poetry explores the meanings, memories, stories, and emotions evoked through colors of pleasure and pain, and the longings of life and growing up in America</p><p>A 1960 graduate of Williams College who did graduate work at Oxford, Beal is the author of five nonfiction books.

We were friendly because he was forever walking an ugly little dog I patted when I bumped into them in the hall.<br>As you've seen from the pictures, he was nothing special to look at. The only odd thing I noticed was his eyeglasses: they were almost always dirty--that foggy, smudged look which makes you want to take out your own hanky and give them a good cleaning.<br>"A good boy." Why do newspapers always use terms like that? "Everyone who knew him thought of the murderer as a good boy who loved his parents, was a member of the Eagle Scouts and spent his spare time collecting Asian stamps."<br>Even my wonderful husband Danny said that after most of the grisly details came out. "He seemed like a good kid, didn't he, Cullen? 'Axe Boy'? Jesus, what a thing to call someone!"<br>"Danny, our young friend 'Axe Boy' Alvin Williams chopped his mother and sister into <i>pieces</i> exactly one floor below our apartment. A good boy he is <i>not</i>."<br>Danny had that quality and most of the time I loved him very much for it: the world is to be forgiven. Axe Boys, dogs that shit in the middle of the sidewalk, dangerous drivers...they know not what they do.<br><i>I</i> forgive nothing. If you stole my orange crayon in the fifth grade, you're still on my hit list, buster.<br>We were eating breakfast and Danny was reading the story to me from the paper. The thought of that murderous creep snoozing below us not long before still made my fanny tingle.<br>"He says he didn't know what came over him."<br>"Oh, really? Well, I hope the next thing that comes over him is a noose!"<br>"Cullen, you've interrupted me four times since I began reading this article to you. Would you like me to go on, or would you rather do a monologue?"<br>But he smiled when he said this because he wasn't really angry. When Danny got angry, he became quiet. Then you ran and hid under the bed for a very long time until he spoke again.<br>"You can go on, but he doesn't deserve any sympathy."<br>Danny ruffled the paper and cleared his throat. "He said he didn't know what came over him because he loved his mother and sister very much." He shook his head. "My God, what would it be like if that was your kid?" He looked at me as if I had the answer. "Whenever you see the parents of a kid like this on television, being interviewed, they always look so hurt and confused. All that time and effort they've put in over the years. The new bicycles they bought, trips to the doctor, packages from Grandma...So what ends up happening? Mom borrows his pen and for some reason he goes totally berserk. I wonder if it was this bad in the old days?"<br>"Danny, please don't start. 'The old days' were probably just as bad as now; people just use them as an excuse to condemn things."<br>"I'm not going to 'star'. It's just that whenever I read about something like this, I get all guilty. You know what I mean? Why should we be so lucky? We still love each other, the baby's great, I make good money...."<br>He shrugged and drank his coffee. There wasn't anything I could say because he was right--we <i>were</i> lucky people, and if I could do anything about it, it would stay that way for the next fifty years.<br>* * *<br>&nbsp;I fell in love with Danny James when it was unfashionable to fall in love with anything but causes. Spell that with a capital "C," please. That was back in the 1970s when everybody hated the war in Vietnam and stores sold only incense and tacky Indian clothes by the million. I shouldn't be so snotty, because I wore too much patchouli perfume and carried my very own copy of <i>The Prophet</i> with me wherever I went. Thank God things change. Is there anyone around whose past doesn't make them cringe?<br>We met in college in New Jersey and were introduced by the girl Danny later married--Evelyn Hernuss, who was my roommate in freshman year.<br>He was in love with her. But at the time I was in love with Jim Vanderberg, so I didn't pay much attention to Danny James. Jim and I were convinced we were destined to get married and go off to a Peace Corps posting in some ravaged section of the world, where they would desperately need us and we would go around feeling like little saints for a couple of years. But the worm turns!<br>Jim and I later broke up over an advanced case of apathy. And three months after their marriage in junior year, Evelyn Hernuss James died in a car crash with her mother and father on their way home from one of Danny's basketball games.<br>I had taken the semester off to campaign for a Presidential peace candidate and was in Chicago when I heard about her death. There was little I could do besides write Danny a letter telling him how sorry I was. Evelyn was one of the good ones--all the way down the line.<br>In what seemed a week, I received a thick letter back from Danny, spilling every gut he had on to the page. I wrote back and he wrote back and I wrote back...And when I returned in the winter, he met me at Newark Airport looking like someone who had barely survived Dachau. He looked so bad he scared me.<br>All of my "Earth Mother" instincts woke right up. Believe me, I had no intention of loving him--I was there to be his friend in need. I had also decided I was going to be "off" love that semester. I was going to be serious, chaste, industrious, unapproachable...and eat only whole-grain foods.<br>We spent a lot of time together. He needed someone he could cry in front of; I needed someone who would make me feel a little less self-involved. Things worked out fine.<br>That was the year he set a school record for scoring and, hate sports as much as I did, I went to as many games as possible. At the beginning I sat in the stands and did my homework, but I couldn't help admiring how smooth and graceful he looked on the court. Soon I stopped doing my homework, became a great fan and knew more about basketball than a serious girl should.<br>When college was over, Danny was offered two tryouts with professional teams, but true to his Marco Polo nature, he decided to play for a team in Milan instead. I thought it was a nice idea but nuts at the same time--and had no hesitation in telling him that. He shrugged and said he didn't want to play basketball for the rest of his life anyway, so here was a way he could play and see things at the same time without the pressure and worry of big-time American pro sports.<br>European pro basketball turned out to be rough and often about as subtle as a brick over the head. The finesse and ballet of the game at its best in the United States is lost. American players who come over are often appalled at the steamroller way they go at it in the "elegant" part of the world.<br>Danny's letters to me that first year abroad were full of wonderful descriptions of games played in youth centers, military bases, gymnasiums that doubled as town halls. The team gave him a car that blew up, and just enough money to keep his elephant's appetite at bay.<br>I was working for a magazine in New York as a researcher and feeling lonely most of the time. Live in New York when you're rich or in love, but avoid it when all you have is a job, a smelly apartment on Tenth Street and an empty dance card. That was the year I spent devouring all the books you're only supposed to read at the beach in the summer. I learned how to cook, and thanked God someone had had the compassion to invent television.<br>During the day I would call places like Alaska and ask distant-voiced scientists about the mating habits of the musk-ox. I was good at my job because I had too much time on my hands and didn't mind putting in extra hours, asking a million extra questions and making perfect copies of my research reports.<br>I dated a bunch of men with names like Richard and Christopher (multisyllable names were "in" again) who, when taken together, didn't add up to one Danny James. His letters from Italy were full of freshness and life. The guys I was seeing were trying their damnedest to be cool and wise and infallible. They took me to grim Bulgarian movies (in the original language) and then explained the story to me afterward in lousy coffeehouses. Danny liked to talk about the funny mistakes he'd made and how silly he'd looked or felt as a result. He would write a whole letter about a meal of bad pasta that would make me laugh out loud. So many of the sentences had his face. Unfortunately for the Richards and Christophers, I would inevitably receive one of these treasured letters a few hours before a date with one of them and, as a result, I'd be a grump all night.<br>Yet, just before summer arrived that year, I did something incredibly stupid. Tired of being efficient by day and lonely by night, I went to bed with a beautiful German photographer named Peter (pronounced "Pay-ter") who made me swoon in my seat the first time he entered the office. Casual affairs had always repelled me, but I had never really experienced lust at first sight. I slept with him on our second date. He took me out for dinner in a very tall building that had a view over all of Manhattan. We ate the most delicious things on the menu and he talked about the ruins of Petra, the game the Afghanis play called <i>bushkhazi</i>, an evening he'd spent at a caf� in Alexandria with Lawrence Durrell.<br>He never looked me in the eye once in all the times we went to bed in the next months. He preferred to rest his handsome chin on my shoulder every time we "made love." He wasn't good and he wasn't bad: he was just "Pay-ter" who told wonderful stories and expected you to do more than he did once you were in bed. Since there was little else in my life then besides letters from the distant Danny James, I convinced myself I was in love with Peter.<br>Psychologists say you should never go food shopping when you're hungry, because at that point everything you see looks delicious and you buy strictly on impulse.

She and her husband live in Arlington, Texas.The queen of mail-order lingerie is the prime suspect in the search for the murderer of a loathsome evangelist. Brown (Texas! Chase, and Texas! Sage, etc.) finds New Orleans predictably steamy. French Silk, the hugely successful peekaboo lingerie catalog business, is awfully like the real-life peekaboo lingerie empire of Victoria's Secret; but instead of being run by an Ohio zillionaire, French Silk is the brainchild of Claire Laurent, a pretty Louisiana enterpreneuse, the only child of a genteelly disturbed New Orleans society belle and an Unnamed Father. For allegedly pandering to the lust of American manhood, French Silk and Miss Laurent have been for some time on the hit list of televangelist Jack Wilde. It is no surprise, then, that New Orleans assistant district attorney Robert Cassidy steers the investigation of Wilde's murder in Miss Laurent's direction. She's not the only suspect, of course. Wilde's white-trash wife and sensitive son had been exploring their step- relationship to an unhealthy extent. And Claire's pistol-packing supermodel business partner was carrying on an illicit affair with a handsome local congressman in the same neighborhood as the crime. And Claire's mamma has these disturbin' blackouts. Miss Laurent, however, seems to have the most strikes against her, and Mr. Cassidy follows her everywhere, his investigation immensely complicated by his lust for the suspect. The feeling is mutual. Glamorous lighting and soft-edged photography fail to disguise the paperback-romance roots of a totally unsurprising whodunit.

As a result, often the people Romans feared most were the "enemies at home," the slaves under their own roofs. Because of this, Roman law decreed that if the head of a household was murdered at home, and the culprit wasn't quickly discovered, his slaves&#x2015;all of them, guilty or not&#x2015;were presumed responsible and were put to death. Without exception. </p><p>When a couple is found dead in their own bedroom and their house burglarized, some of their household slaves know what is about to happen to them.

Albia, a private informer just like her father, Marcus Didius Falco, is asked to solve the murders, in this mystery from Lindsey Davis.</p></p><p><p>LINDSEY DAVIS is the author of <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling series of historical mysteries featuring Marcus Didius Falco.

Never take on clients who cannot pay you. Never do favors for friends. Don&#x2019;t work with relatives. Think carefully about legal work. If, like me, you are a woman, keep clear of men you find attractive.</p> <p>The Aviola inquiry broke every one of those rules, not least because the clients had no money, yet I took it on. Will I never learn?</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>One warm, starry June night in the city of Rome, burglars invaded a ground-floor apartment on the Esquiline Hill. A large quantity of fine domestic silverware was taken, which people assumed was the primary target. The middle-aged couple who rented the fashionable suite had married only recently, which made what happened to them more poignant. After the robbers left, their bodies were found on the marital bed, amid signs of violent struggle. Both had been strangled.</p> <p>The dead couple were wealthy enough to merit an investigation, a privilege that was generally thought too good for the poor, though it was normally available to victims who had left behind influential friends, as was the case here. Inquiries were first assigned to a vigiles officer, Titianus of the Second Cohort. In fairness, Titianus was no more inept than most vigiles. He knew that two plus two made four&#x2014;unless he happened to be preoccupied with watching a good cockfight, when he might inadvertently say five. But he had a decent record of arresting pickpockets in the Market of Livia. For about two hours he even thought that trying to solve a double murder was exciting. Then reality set in.</p> <p>Titianus found it impossible to identify the thief or thieves. After asking around a bit, he turned his attention to the household, declaring that this must be an inside job. Inevitably his gaze fell on the owners&#x2019; freedmen and slaves. The freedmen were mature, articulate and well organized; that was how they had managed to gain their liberty and how they now bamboozled Titianus. The slaves were more vulnerable: younger and naive, or else older and plain dim. Nobody ever said any of them had threatened their master and mistress, but to a law officer in Rome any culprits were better than none and with slaves no real proof was necessary. They could be accused, tortured, prosecuted and executed on simple probability. Titianus put on a clean tunic to look good, then went and announced to his cohort tribune that he had the answer. The slaves did it.</p> <p>The slaves got wind of their plight. They knew the notorious Roman law when a head of household was murdered at home. By instinct the authorities went after the wife, but that was no use if she was dead too. So unless the dead man had another obvious enemy, his slaves fell under suspicion. Whether guilty or not, they were put to death. All of them.</p> <p>The good thing about such systematic capital punishment, occurring in public of course, was that it helped make other slaves, of whom there were hundreds of thousands in Rome, more well behaved. The proportion of masters to slaves was very small, so nobody wanted this big slave population to get the idea of staging a rebellion. In our city it had been decided not to dress slaves in any distinguishing way, because then they might realize the power of their own numbers.</p> <p>Many owners lived in constant fear of slaves turning against them. You cannot batter loyalty into a sullen, captive foreigner and neither can you even guarantee that kindly treatment will gain their gratitude. In Rome, executing slaves who betrayed their masters was therefore extremely popular. At least it was among the slave-owning classes.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>Terrified, and with good reason, some of the accused slaves bolted from the elegant Esquiline house and took refuge a distance away at the Temple of Ceres. By tradition, this monument on the Aventine Hill offered a haven for refugees. They could claim sanctuary, be kept safe and even hope to be fed.</p> <p>In theory, the authorities fostered the great temple&#x2019;s famous role as a focus of liberty and protector of the desperate. However, nobody wants to take fine ideals too far.</p> <p>In a swift, panic-stricken meeting just after dawn, the issue of how to get rid of the fugitives was handed to a magistrate whose duties gave him close connections to the temple. His name was Manlius Faustus, one of that year&#x2019;s plebeian aediles, and I knew him. I liked his methods. He always stayed calm.</p> <p>Charged with solving the problem, Faustus solemnly agreed with the Temple of Ceres authorities that it was important to take the correct action. This situation could easily turn ugly. They wanted to avoid censure. The public were shouting for a solution, preferably bloody. The <i>Daily Gazette</i> had already asked for a quotable comment and was about to feature the story in its scandal section; publication would fire lurid Forum gossip. The unseen eye of the emperor was probably on the Temple. Faustus had been handed a rather hot platter here.</p> <p>As this dutiful man tried to come up with ideas, he walked to a bar called the Stargazer. There, while he pondered the meager choice for breakfast, he ran into me.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Lindsey Davis</p></p><h2>M�n</h2><p><b>Following on the Giller Prize-nominated and Governor General's Literary Award-winning success of <i>Ru,</i> Kim Th�y's latest novel is a triumph of poetic beauty and a moving meditation on how love and food are inextricably entwined.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; M�n has three mothers: the one who gives birth to her in wartime, the nun who plucks her from a vegetable garden, and her beloved Maman, who becomes a spy to survive.

She gave me a second birth by bringing me up in a big city, an anonymous elsewhere, behind a schoolyard, surrounded by children who envied me for having a mother who taught school and sold iced bananas.<br><br>Very early every morning, before classes started, we went grocery shopping. We started with the woman who sold ripe coconuts, rich in flesh and poor in juice. The lady grated the first half-coconut with the cap of a soft drink bottle nailed to the end of a flat stick. Long strips fell in a decorative frieze, like ribbons, on the banana leaf spread out on the stall. The merchant talked non-stop and kept asking Maman the same question: &#x201c;What do you feed that child to give her such red lips?&#x201d; To avoid that question, I got in the habit of pressing my lips together, but I was so fascinated by how quickly she grated the second half that I always watched her with my mouth partly open. She set her foot on a long black metal spatula that had part of its handle sitting on a small wooden bench. Without looking at the pointed teeth at the rounded end of the spatula, she crumbled the nut at the speed of a machine.<br><br>The fall of the crumbs through the hole in the spatula must just resemble the flight of snowflakes in Santa Claus country, Maman always said, which was actually something her own mother would say. She spoke her mother&#x2019;s words to hear her voice again. And whenever she saw boys playing soccer with an empty tin can, she couldn&#x2019;t help but whisper <i>londi</i>, in her mother&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>That was my first word of French: <i>londi</i>. In Vietnamese, <i>lon</i> means &#x201c;tin can&#x201d; and <i>&#x111;i</i>, &#x201c;to go away.&#x201d; In French, the two sounds together create <i>lundi</i> in the ear of a Vietnamese woman. Following her own mother&#x2019;s example, she taught me the French word by asking me to point to the tin can then kick it, saying <i>lon &#x111;i</i> for <i>lundi</i>. So that second day of the week is the most beautiful of all for Maman because her mother died before teaching her how to pronounce the other days. Only <i>lundi</i> was associated with a clear, unforgettable image. The other six days were absent from any reference, therefore all alike. That&#x2019;s why my mother often confused <i>mardi</i> with <i>jeudi</i> and sometimes reversed <i>samedi</i> and <i>mercredi</i>.<br><br>Before her mother died, though, she&#x2019;d had time to learn how to extract the milk from a coconut by squeezing chunks of crumbled flesh saturated with hot water. When mothers taught their daughters how to cook, they spoke in hushed tones, whispering so that neighbours couldn&#x2019;t steal recipes and possibly seduce their husbands with the same dishes. Culinary traditions are passed on secretly, like magic tricks between master and apprentice, one movement at a time, following the rhythms of each day. In the natural order, then, girls learned to measure the amount of water for cooking rice with the first joint of the index finger, to cut &#x201c;vicious peppers&#x201d; (<i>&#x1a1;&#x301;t hi�&#x309;m</i>) with the point of the knife to transform them into harmless flowers, to peel mangoes from base to stem so they won&#x2019;t go against the direction of the fibres . . .<br><br>That was how I learned from my mother that of the dozens of kinds of bananas sold at the market, only the <i>chu�&#x301;i xie&#x302;m</i> could be flattened without being crushed and frozen without turning black. When I first came to Montreal, I prepared it as a treat for my husband, who hadn&#x2019;t eaten it for twenty years. I wanted him to taste once again the typical marriage of peanuts and coconut, two ingredients that in south Vietnam are served as much at dessert as at breakfast. I hoped to be able to serve and be a companion to my husband without disturbing anything, a little like flavours that are hardly noticed because they are ever-present.<br><br>Maman entrusted me to this man out of motherly love, just as the nun, my second mother, had given me to her, thinking about my future. Because Maman was preparing for her death, knowing that one day she would no longer be around, she sought a husband for me who would have the qualities of a father. One of her friends, acting as matchmaker, brought him to visit us one afternoon. Maman asked me to serve the tea, that was all. I did not look at the face of the man even when I set the cup in front of him. My gaze wasn&#x2019;t required, it was only his that mattered.<br><br>He had come from far away and didn&#x2019;t have much time. Several families were waiting to introduce him to their daughters. He was from Saigon but had left Vietnam at twenty, as one of the boat people. He had spent several years in a refugee camp in Thailand before coming to Montreal, where he&#x2019;d found work but not exactly a home. He was one of those who had lived too long in Vietnam to become Canadian. And conversely, who have lived too long in Canada to be Vietnamese again.</p><h2>Lewis Mumford: A Life</h2><p>Traces the life of the noted American writer, discusses his major works, and offers a glimpse of his complex personality.</p><p>One of the world's foremost experts on cities, architecture and the impact of technology on civilization, Mumford is also a prophet (a Jonah, as he thinks of himself) who took early stands against McCarthyism and the Vietnam War, who has thundered against social and political abuses and has constantly warned of the dangers of rampant urban expansion. Yet, for all this outspokenness and his 30-odd books--which include Technics and Civilization , his masterwork The City in History and an autobiography--he has remained an elusive figure. In this solid first biography--a 10-year labor based on the massive Mumford archive, both public and hitherto private--Miller ( The New American Radicalism) provides a rich and balanced portrait of the man, his personality, family life, friendships, achievements and, above all, the ideas that have been his primary building blocks. The volume makes it easy to understand why Malcolm Cowley called Mumford "the last of the great humanists." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This extensive biography, written with access to Mumford's private and personal papers, discusses his books and thoughts on cities, city and regional planning, culture, civilization, and humanism. But the key focus is on the intimate details of his personal development, particularly his struggles with his rigid, highly disciplined personality, and his sexual life, especially the affairs that brought him emotional release and fed his creative energies but threatened his marriage. While Miller is revealing, sympathetic, and reasonable on these latter aspects of Mumford's life, he treats Mumford's ideas in rather simple fashion, largely omitting current thinking on key issues and only rarely and briefly quoting directly from his works. (When Mumford is quoted, he lights up the page.) Extensive and useful, but less penetrating than one might hope.<br><i>- Richard Kuczkowski, Dominican Coll., Blauvelt, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Suspiria de Profundis and Other Writings</h2><p>Thomas De Quincey was an English author during the Romantic movement, associating with writers like Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Best known for his command of the psychological fantasy story, De Quincey produced stories of the curious and obscure, but always with the traditional Romantic emphasis on feeling. His masterwork, &#34;Confessions of an English Opium Eater&#34; (1821), stemmed from his own laudanum addiction, and was followed by &#34;Suspiria de Profundis&#34;, a collection of essays which continued to capture the same dark brilliance as in &#34;Confessions&#34;. The collection was originally published in fragmentary form, and remained unfinished upon De Quincey&#39;s death in 1859. This edition includes &#34;The Affliction of Childhood,&#34; a reflection on the death of the author&#39;s two sisters in childhood, &#34;Levana and our Ladies of Sorrow,&#34; one of his best-known works about the Roman goddess of childbirth, and &#34;The English Mail-Coach,&#34; on the &#34;grandeur and power&#34; of the English mail-coach system.</p><p></p><h2>Leros</h2><p>The Greek island of Leros was for 20 years and more the site of the world&#39;s most notorious and brutal asylum for the insane. The Magnum photographer Alex Majoli has chronicled its inmates and their return to a sane world and integration into society, the work of the famed Italian psychiatrist Franco Basaglia. Leros raises a number of questions. How could such a regime have existed? And how could anyone have survived it? This book was given the Judges&#39; Special Recognition in the best books category of the International Pictures of the Year Awards 2003 and included in the PDN Photography Annual 2003 in the best books category.</p><p>Alex Majoli is a member of the Magnum Photographic Agency. Recognised for his work in the Balkan wars of the 1990s and his social reportage, he was born in Ravenna in 1971. He became a full-time photojournalist for the Grazia-Neri Agency in 1990. He has contributed to Newsweek, the New York Times Magazine and National Geographic. In 2003 he was the recipient of the International Center of Photography&#39;s Infinity Award for Photojournalism. He lives and works in Milan and New York.</p><h2>Felix Gonzales-Torres</h2><p>Born in Cuba, Felix Gonzalez-Torres is best known for public artworks which invite the viewer's participation. In this publication, illustrated with video and performance stills and reproductions; the artist talks about his commitment to social change and the role of the artist in society. One of the few indepth publications on this pivotal conceptual artist. Limited edition of 200. Dimension: 8 3/8 x 12� inches, 63 b&amp;w and color reproductions.</p><p>Cuban-born Gonzalez-Torres is probably best known for his potent billboard project, in which austere photographs of an empty, rumpled, white bed were placed at over 20 locations around New York City to serve as reminders of the dogged AIDS crisis. The artist does not confine himself to one medium, however. Gonzalez-Torres has exhibited text paintings, designed photographic jigsaw puzzles, enlisted live gallery performers, and created sculpture in the form of stacks of paper, which viewers are invited to take away. On the surface, his work is reminiscent of the minimalists, but form is not his exclusive concern. His pieces function as three-dimensional poetry that, above all, requires a public to engage it. Part of the publisher's series highlighting emerging artists, this book catalogs most of the artist's recent work in the form of handsome photodocumentation. Accompanying texts include an introduction by Susan Cahill and an extended conversation with fellow artist Tim Rollins. Though not especially provocative, the discusssion is appealing for its tone of two friends casually but genuinely discussing lofty artistic concepts. Certainly not the last book on this fine young artist, this is a fine summation of his career so far.

Lawrence Duket, goldsmith, kills Ralph Crepyn, moneylender, and flees to London's St. Mary Le Bow for sanctuary. The next day Duket is found hanged inside the locked church, an apparent suicide. Bishop Burnell, Chancellor for King Edward I, assigns Corbett to investigate. Burnell fears that the antiroyal Populares party will join with practitioners of devil worshipat this time, "Christianity is only skin deep." Hugh Corbett is threatened and attacked while probing "a suicide which was really murder which . . . masked treason, sorcery and rebellion." The santanist group seems to be centered at The Mitre, a tavern owned by the beautiful Alice atte Bowe, with whom Corbett falls in love.

Ian Fleming&#x2019;s final 007 novel is a fitting tribute to a unique British hero.</p><p>Ian Fleming was born in London on May 28, 1908. He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p><p><b>1. 'CAN I HELP YOU?'</b></p> <p>The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even from very senior officers in the organisation. Only M and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top Secret record known as 'The War Book' so that, in the event of the death of both of them, the whole story, apart from what is available to individual Sections and Stations, would be available to their successors.</p> <p>One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn't know was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the public, whether friendly or otherwise - drunks, lunatics, bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p> <p>On that cold, clear morning in November he was to see the careful cog-wheels in motion.</p> <p>The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence flicked the switch to 'Hold' and said to her neighbour, 'It's another nut who says he's James Bond. Even knows his code number. Says he wants to speak to M personally.'</p> <p>The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond's death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the Press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who, at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond from Uranus where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting entry into heaven. She said, 'Put him through to Liaison, Pat.'</p> <p>The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine, the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: 'Just a moment, sir. I'll put you on to an officer who may be able to help you.'</p> <p>James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>He had expected some delay before he could establish his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the charming 'Colonel Boris' who had been in charge of him for the past few months after he had finished his treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt in Leningrad. A man's voice came on the line. 'Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?'</p> <p>James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. 'This is Commander James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you put me through to M, or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny. I want to make an appointment.'</p> <p>Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for the use of his department, the other alerted one of the duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation, trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near five minutes as possible. He said, 'I'm afraid I don't know either of these two people. Are you sure you've got the right number?'</p> <p>James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number which was the main outside line for the Secret Service. Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it down among the small print on the front page of his forged British passport that said his name was Frank Westmacott, company director.</p> <p>'Yes,' said Captain Walker sympathetically. 'We seem to have got that part of it right. But I'm afraid I can't place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly are they? This Mr Em, for instance. I don't think we've got anyone of that name at the Ministry.'</p> <p>'Do you want me to spell it out? You realise this is an open line?'</p> <p>Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence in the speaker's voice. He pressed another button and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang. He said, 'Hang on a moment, would you? There's someone on my other line.' Captain Walker got on to the head of his Section. ' Sorry, sir. I've got a chap on who says he's James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it sounds crazy and I've gone through the usual motions with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.'</p> <p>Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief Security Officer for the Secret Service, said 'Blast!' and pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life. The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly needed a cigarette, but his room was now 'live' to Captain Walker and to the lunatic who called himself 'James Bond'. Captain Walker's voice came over at full strength. 'I'm sorry. Now then. This man Mr Em you want to talk to. I'm sure we needn't worry about security. Could you be more specific?'</p> <p>James Bond frowned. He didn't know that he had frowned and he wouldn't have been able to explain why he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again inexplicably, 'Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of a department in your Ministry. The number of his room used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl. Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff's name? No? Well let's see, it's Wednesday. Shall I tell you what'll be the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be steak-and-kidney pudding.'</p> <p>The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James Bond,' Damn! There's the other telephone again. Shan't be a minute.' He picked up the green telephone. 'Yes, sir?' '</p> <p>I don't like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding. Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that. Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about 007's death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing it pretty close to the chest. The Stone Face act. It's just possible. Keep me informed, would you?'</p> <p>Captain Walker got back to James Bond. 'Sorry about that. It's being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of yours. Afraid I can't help you myself. Not my part of the Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a pencil? It's No. 44 Kensington Cloisters. Got that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten minutes and I'll have a word with him and see if he can help. All right?'</p> <p>James Bond said dully, 'That's very kind of you.' He put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p> <p>James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel Boris had told him to do so. Bond's file in the KGB Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in London, he must stick to the KGB image of the high life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street entrance. A man at the news stand got a good profile of him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire for a taxi, a canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring goods entrance and, in due course, the same van followed Bond's taxi while a man inside the van reported briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p> <p>No. 44 Kensington Cloisters was a dull Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been chosen for its purpose because it had once been the headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement, and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this long-defunct organisation, the empty shell of which had been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and a rear exit into a quiet mews. The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the process of developing the canonflex film went on in its interior.</p> <p>'Appointment with Major Townsend,' said Bond.</p> <p>'Yes. He's expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?' The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a coathanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely doseted with Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory on the first floor where its provenance would be established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket dust would be removed for more leisurely research. 'Would you follow me, sir?'</p> <p>It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard with a tall, single window which concealed the Fluoroscope triggered automatically from beneath the ugly patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage ended in two facing doors marked 'A' and 'B'. The doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond to enter.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, very light room, dose-carpeted in dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire burned under an Adam mantelpiece which bore a number of silver trophies and two photographs in leather frames - one of a nice-looking woman and the other of three nice-looking children. There was a central table with a bowl of flowers and two comfort-able club chain on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets, nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the room, got up from the far chair, dropped The Times on the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p> <p>This was the Soft Man.</p> <p>'Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old Senior Service.'</p> <p>Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded remark - a reference to Bond's liking for the Morland Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond's apparent lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up straight Major Townsend said, 'Well now. How can I help you?'</p> <p>Across the corridor, in Room A, a cold Office-of-Works cube with no furnitu...</p></p><h2>Poetry, Language, Thought</h2><p>Essential reading for students and anyone interested in the great philosophers.

Here he offers an unauthorized portrait of the generous, socially responsible, and ever-creative Bonnie Raitt. Bego does gush, but we Raitt fans demand a certain amount of reverence for our heroine, and Raitt has kept her private life so private we're grateful for any information, however facile. Raitt comes by her music and her political activism naturally: her mother is an accomplished pianist, her father is Broadway star John Raitt, and both are Quakers. But her love for the blues, her feisty independence, and her artistic authority are all her own. Bego lovingly describes the production of each of Raitt's innovative and heart-winning albums, capturing the essence of her highly original, sexy, "womanly-wise" music. Commercial success was long in coming to Raitt because she never played glamour girl or compromised her artistic integrity, so when she received four Grammy Awards in 1990, her many loyal fans rejoiced. And they'll be on the lookout for this overdue tribute. <i>Donna Seaman</i>It took Raitt over 20 years to make it big as a mainstream blues singer, and her struggles are chronicled in this unauthorized account by prolific celebrity biographer Bego (most recently as ghostwriter for Martha Reeves's Dancing in the Streets, LJ 8/94). Though such bios usually put fear in the hearts of their subjects, this is an unabashedly flattering portrait. Raitt was born into show business (her father is Broadway star John Raitt). She left college to become a serious student of the blues and a political activist. She struggled and partied until alcoholism led her to Alcoholics Anonymous. Two years later she won four Grammies and, at age 40, found personal happiness with her marriage to actor Michael O'Keefe. Bego did not work with Raitt but relied mostly on print interviews, and that is the book's greatest weakness.

All these years I thought I&#x2019;d been simply lying.&#x201d; Crossman is a humorist in the Mark Twain mold: wry, satiric, and keenly aware of the shortcomings of human beings, but with a leavening of self-deprecation and underlying sympathy. Though rooted in a regional consciousness (coastal Maine), his humor succeeds in making the local universal. Away Happens considers daily life on an island in Penobscot Bay that supports both a tight-knit local community and a larger seasonal population. Whether he is recounting a debate that happened at the Lions Club over who counts as a &#x201c;local&#x201d; or describing his adventures getting the Thanksgiving turkey into the oven, ruminating on how the ferry schedule shapes island life or recalling a local crime spree, Crossman is funny, unsentimental, and authentically Maine. &#x201c;There are only two places, Here, this island off the coast of Maine, and Away. Here, this place, is a small place and Away, everywhere else, is a big place, but make no mistake about it, Here is Here and Away is not. 1276 people live Here. Billions more live Away than live Here, although increasingly, during the summer, it seems otherwise.&#x201d; &#x2015;From the Book</p><p>5 1/2 x 8 1/2 trim.PHIL CROSSMAN is the owner of the Tidewater Motel on Vinalhaven Island, Maine.

With these widely felt grievances to build on, the Socialists led the class-conscious farmers and workers to a radicalism that was far in advance of that advocated by the earlier People&#x2019;s party.</p><p> Examined in this broadly based study of the movement are popular leaders like Oklahoma&#x2019;s Oscar Ameringer (&#x201c;The Mark Twain of American Socialism&#x201d;), &#x201c;Red Tom&#x201d; Hickey of Texas, and Kate Richards O&#x2019;Hare, who was second only to Eugene Debs as a Socialist orator. Included also is information on the party&#x2019;s propaganda techniques, especially those used in the lively newspapers which claimed fifty thousand subscribers in the Southwest by 1913, and on the attractive summer camp meetings which drew thousands of poor white tenant farmers to week-long agitation and education sessions.</p></p><p>James R.

He has appeared on many radio and television shows and is active in the Cuban American community.Fontova gets right to the work of debunking familiar notions of Argentinan revolutionary Ernesto "Che" Guevera; by the end of the preface, he's pinned 14,000 executions on Guevera and credited positive portrayals to the public relations work of Castro and the laziness of biographers. The critical attack continues throughout, combining the testimonies of former revolutionaries and Cuban refugees to assemble a damning portrait of a man lauded by everyone from Jean-Paul Sartre to Jon Lee Anderson. According to Fontova, the real Che was "a revolutionary Ringo Starr" who "fell in with the right bunch and rode their coattails to world fame." Presenting a failed physician, an inept guerrilla and a hapless sycophant, Fontova adds insult to injury by claiming Che was "deathly afraid to drive a motorcycle." Fontova's charged language keeps things interesting, if occasionally dubious; midway through the book, after asserting that Che enjoyed killing dogs, Fontova concedes that, "You might put down your book here and think, this has to be propaganda." Though propaganda probably colors any consideration of this controversial figure, Fontova makes a convincing case that, in the words of one former political prisoner, "There was something seriously wrong with Che Guevera." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Into this potential trouble spot comes CID superintendent Vachell, looking into Nazi plans. Mixed with the Bund activities are various small local atrocitiesa governess's pigeons decapitated, the paws cut off a pet dog. Soon a local farmer, Karl Munson, former head of the local Bund, is found dead in his pyrethrum-drying shed. Was it murder as his widow claims, or an accident as the doctor and autopsy seem to indicate? Munson had a reputation as a womanizer; he'd made a strong play for Janice West of the farm next door. He also virtually disinherited his wife and children and may have been a blackmailer. The superintendent, who is staying at the West farm, finds himself in a difficult position: he is the guest of prime suspects, and he is falling in love with his host's wife. A bush fire, further bloodshed and a near brush with death lead Vachell to the killer and the hope for a new life.

His San Francisco studio produces beautiful food photography for editorial and advertising media.Here's a book about breadcomprehensive to a faultthat has risen and risen and gone everywhere. Certainly it's fit for the coffee table: the full-page color photographs are masterfully glossy. The whimsy of form sometimes reigns over fact, as when a delicate loaf is depicted alighting on a bed of creamy cheese spread without going soggy. And bread as the staff of life is neglected once the recipes get sweeter and more exotic and finally arrive at jams, butters, mustards, spreads and "the art of melba." On the way, though, are very appealing true-blue breads, many original and calling only for ordinary ingredients. Sections on savory and sweet breads are exceptionally good. Directions are usually explicit, and no recipe in this elegantly designed book requires a baker to turn the page. A section on basics, however, is no more than adequate; a novice would have a hard time figuring out how to knead. Hensperger's spiritual enthusiasm for bread-baking can compromise her clarity. She would do well to consider the art of the paragraph, as well as that of the mixing bowl. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Becoming One: A Story of Triumph Over Multiple Personality Disorder</h2><p>Accounts of Multiple Personality Disorder have usually been written by mental health professionals as texts or case studies. Now, in Becoming One, Sarah Olson has allowed us the rare privilege of entering her internal world in her first-person account of her journey from fragmentation to wholeness. Two little girls, the author and her sister, were routinely terrorized and assaulted over a period of years by a family friend. One grew up closed and withdrawn, the other angry and self-destructive. And, most painful of all, their common suffering resulted in estrangement from each other. Becoming One began as Olson&#39;s attempt to provide a written account of her memories for her sister as a means of reconciliation and healing. The author&#39;s courage and generosity in candidly sharing her remarkable experiences provide important insights into the world of dissociation. Here is at once a highly personal look into an individual life, the dynamics of a troubled family, and the healing power of the therapeutic process.</p><p>Several abused as a young girl, Sarah Olson began at age three to dissociate (to split herself into a number of "alters"). While internal personalities were an essential part of her survival from extreme trauma, Sarah was not herself fully cognizant of their existence until she underwent therapy with the gifted psychotherapist, Howard Asher. With Asher's support and guidance, Sarah eventually overcame numerous life obstacles and challenges to become fully integrated. Becoming One documents Sarah's four-year process of discovery and recovery. Utilizing letters she wrote to Asher, and transcripts from key audiotaped therapy sessions, Sarah created a book which offers a model of healing and hope to the many survivors of childhood abuse, whether or not they personally experience dissociation. Becoming One is an important contribution to the growing movement of survivors and their allies working to put an end to childhood sexual abuse. Becoming One is a hopeful book which both dignifies people with Dissociative Identity Disorder, and sensitizes the rest of us to what that means and what can be done.

But with each page turn, Aput learns &nbsp;more about caring for a baby and, with a little help from his friends, he discovers what a baby needs most is love.</p><p>As a kid, Rosalinde loved to draw, write plays and create sets for her puppets. So, after high school, she went to study art at the �cole Nationale Sup�rieure des Arts D�coratifs in Paris. Since graduating, she has written and/or illustrated numerous children&#39;s books. She lives in Versailles, France.PreS&#x2014;When Aput, an arctic fox, finds a goose egg on the tundra, he becomes an instant father. As soon as the adorable chick hatches, her first words are "Daddy Honk Honk!" Aput is not sure he knows how to raise the wee gosling, so he goes in search of a foster family. Mama lemming has no room but gives Aput a tiny striped hat to keep the little one warm. Lily the rabbit offers some food, and Nanouk the yoga-practicing bear recommends lots of sleep for babies. As Aput and the gosling's journey together progresses, the fox takes in all of the advice and starts to delight in his paternal role. Bonnet's winsome watercolor illustrations show the energetic hatchling perched on Aput's tail while the fox cooks in the kitchen. At the end of the day, the pair snuggle in a rocking chair and enjoy a bedtime story. Under the northern lights, Aput and friends name his new baby Aurora, and they joyfully celebrate her birth. VERDICT Perfect for Father's Day, this sweet tale shows how love makes a family. A great choice for one-on-one and small group sharing.&#x2014;Linda Ludke, London Public Library, Ont.</p><h2>Hope Against Hope</h2><p>&#39;Suddently, at about one o&#39;clock in the morning, there was a sharp, unbearably explicit knock on the door. &#39;They&#39;ve come for Osip&#39;, I said&#39;. In 1933 the poet Osip Mandelstam- friend to Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova- wrote a spirited satire denouncing Josef Stalin. It proved to be a sixteen-line death sentence. For his one act of defiance he was arrested by the Cheka, the secret police, interrogated, exiled and eventually re-arrested. He died en route to one of Stalin&#39;s labour camps. His wife, Nadezhda (1899-1980) was with him on both occasions when he was arrested, and she loyally accompanied him into exile in the Urals, where he wrote his last great poems. Although his mind had been unbalanced by his ordeal in prison, his spirit remained unbroken. Eager to solve &#39;the Mandelstam problem&#39;, the Soviet authorities invited the couple to stay in a rest home near Moscow. Nadezhda saw it as an opportunity for her husband to mend his shattered life, but it was a trap and he was arrested for the last time. &#39;My case will never be closed&#39;, Osip once said, and it is mostly through the courageous efforts of Nadezhda that his memory has been preserved. Hope against Hope, her first volume of memoirs, is a vivid and disturbing account of her last four years with her husband, the efforts she made to secure his release, to rescue his manuscripts from oblivion, and later, tragically, to discover the truth about his mysterious death. It is also a harrowing, first-hand account of how Stalin and his henchmen persecuted Russia&#39;s literary intelligentsia in the 1930s and beyond. Nadezhda Mandelstam spent most of the Second World War in Tashkent, living with her friend Akhmatova. Only in 1964 was she at last granted permission to return to Moscow. Here she began Hope against Hope, and later Hope Abandoned, the two memoirs of her life.</p><p>Nadezhda means "hope" in Russian. And Nadezhda Mandelstam, wife of Osip Mandelstam, one of the greatest Russian poets of the 20th century, is aptly named, for it is hope alone that seems to have buoyed her strength during very trying times. In this, the first of two volumes of her memoirs, she offers a harrowing account of the last four years she spent with her late husband. She re-creates in terse, stripped-to-the-bone sentences the atmosphere of intense paranoia that enveloped Russia's literary intelligentsia. In 1933, Osip had written a lighthearted satire ridiculing Stalin. It proved to be a 16-line death sentence. Nadezhda recalls the night the secret police came for him: "There was a sharp, unbearably explicit knock on the door. 'They've come for Osip,' I said." He was arrested, interrogated, exiled, and eventually rearrested. Nadezhda chronicles each turn of event, describing her feelings of heartbreak and joy with self-effacing discipline. Not only does Mandelstam write with the vitality and insight of the classic Russian novelists, she is far too selfless to write an account of her own travails. Instead, she acts as witness to a society's. Similarly, although Osip's mind became unbalanced by his ordeal in prison, his spirit remained unbroken; it is this liberating, imaginative force that Nadezhda celebrates in <i>Hope Against Hope</i>. <i>--Lilian Pizzichini, Amazon.co.uk</i>Hope Against Hope was first published in English in 1970. It is Nadezhda Mandelstam&#39;s memoir of her life with Osip, who was first arrested in 1934 and died in Stalin&#39;s Great Purge of 1937-38. Hope Against Hope is a vital eyewitness account of Stalin&#39;s Soviet Union and one of the greatest testaments to the value of literature and imaginative freedom ever written. But it is also a profound inspiration - a love story that relates the daily struggle to keep both love and art alive in the most desperate circumstances.</p><h2>Where I Belong</h2><p>No one is kind to sixth-grader Brendan Doyle: his foster mother, his teachers, his classmates, and especially the thugs who bully him. He takes refuge in books, drawing, carving, and daydreaming. When Brendan stumbles upon an old man near his tree house in the Virginia woods, he is quick to believe that this is the magical Green Man, guardian spirit of the forest. Brendan&#39;s need to immerse himself in his fantasy world becomes more acute, until he meets a girl with secrets of her own who may just keep his feet on the ground.</p><p><p><b>Mary Downing Hahn</b>, a former children&#x2019;s librarian, is the award-winning author of many popular ghost stories.

What&#x2019;s the use? They&#x2019;ll all be wrong, and Mrs. Funkhauser will make some sarcastic comment about my inability to learn long division&#x2014;as if I cared about something as useless as long division, which has no value in my opinion except to sort stupid kids from smart ones, and you know where that puts me. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; If our classroom had windows, I could watch the sky and the clouds and the trees, maybe a few birds flying past on their way to someplace where there&#x2019;s no math, but when my school was built they wanted something called open space. No walls between rooms. Just chest-high bookcases to divide kids up into what they call pods, which makes us all baby whales, I guess.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No windows, either&#x2014;only skylights in the ceiling. You can&#x2019;t look outside unless you want to sprain your neck watching clouds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open space&#x2014;how could there ever be such a thing in a school where all the spaces are closed off and you are trapped inside until you are sixteen and then maybe, just maybe, you will be free but everyone says no, you will be working in McDonald&#x2019;s if you don&#x2019;t go to college? Four more years after thirteen years of public school only with professors (what do they profess?) and majors and minors, which sounds like the army to me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, why am I worrying about college? I&#x2019;m not smart enough to go. What college would take a kid who can&#x2019;t even add and subtract? A kid who&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#x2019;s when I hear Mrs. Funkhauser say, &#x201c;Time&#x2019;s up, boys and girls. Hand in your math sheets.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at the picture I&#x2019;ve drawn of the Green Man. I just learned about him in a book of British myths and legends. He dwells deep in the woods and is seldom seen, partly because his face is almost hidden by clusters of oak leaves that seem to grow from his skin and sprout from his mouth. He protects the forest and all that dwell there&#x2014;animals, birds, and trees. Those who respect the natural world need not fear him, but those who harm the forest will feel his wrath. Like a superhero, he fears nothing. He is just. And powerful.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Green Man is treetop tall. He carries a sword. His beard is long and thick, his mustache curls, and his face is framed with oak leaves. His wavy hair falls to his shoulders like mine. It&#x2019;s the best picture I&#x2019;ve ever drawn, and I don&#x2019;t want Mrs. Funkhauser to see it. I begin to slide it quietly under my notebook.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly she&#x2019;s beside me. &#x201c;Where is your math sheet, Brendan?&#x201d; The heat of her anger scorches my skin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t say anything. I stare at my desk. The back of my neck feels like it&#x2019;s on fire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The giggling starts. It&#x2019;s almost time to go home. The whales are restless. They&#x2019;re hoping for a last-minute Funkhauser vs. Brendan show, a high note to end the boring day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; Mrs. Funkhauser&#x2019;s eyes are eagle sharp. They see everything, even the corner of my math sheet sticking out from my notebook. With one quick move, her talons jerk my paper from its hiding place. She looks at the problems. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t even tried, Brendan. What have you been doing all this time?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep my head down and say nothing. <i>Please don&#x2019;t look at the back of my paper. Please don&#x2019;t tear up my picture</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course she turns my paper over. She pauses to increase suspense. The whales squirm in their seats, ready to be entertained. Where&#x2019;s the popcorn? Who&#x2019;s got the soda?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Funkhauser holds my drawing up for the whales to see. &#x201c;Boys and girls,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;look at this. Brendan Doyle thinks drawing pictures is more important than math.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I <i>know</i> drawing is more important than math, but I sit there, head down, silent, waiting for the bell to ring, braced to run out the door faster than the whales. If they catch me, I&#x2019;ll need the magic sword I haven&#x2019;t got.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whales laugh and Mrs. Funkhauser smiles at them&#x2014;they&#x2019;re smart, they know what&#x2019;s important. They&#x2019;ve learned their multiplication and long division, their fractions and ratios and decimals. They hand in their homework on time, neatly done, they follow directions, they pay attention. If they have to work at McDonald&#x2019;s, they will always remember to say, &#x201c;Do you want fries with that?&#x201d; and &#x201c;Have a nice day.&#x201d; Their parents are proud of them. No one thinks they&#x2019;re weird.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Funkhauser crumples my drawing into a small wad of paper. My heart crumples too. But I don&#x2019;t look up and I don&#x2019;t say anything. I pretend Mrs. Funkhauser is being eaten by a dragon while the Green Man looks the other way. Saving her would be a waste of time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Funkhauser sighs. &#x201c;What am I going to do with you, Brendan?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shrug. I don&#x2019;t know what to do with me. Or her. Or anyone else.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why won&#x2019;t you do your work? How do you expect to succeed in life?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whales laugh. What a joke. Me succeed in life? Hah-hah.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Get that hair out of your face. Look at me when I&#x2019;m talking to you!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I don&#x2019;t move, Mrs. Funkhauser lifts my chin and forces me to look at her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never get anywhere in this world unless you change your attitude and learn to cooperate. The way you&#x2019;re going, you won&#x2019;t pass sixth grade.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I care. I&#x2019;ve slid through every grade since I started school. I pass only because I read so well, not because I do my work. Besides, I hear it&#x2019;s bad to flunk a kid, because you&#x2019;ll damage his self-esteem. Maybe Mrs. Funkhauser has figured out I have no self-esteem to damage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you listening to me? Do you want to repeat sixth grade?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shrug. I want to say <i>Yes. So I won&#x2019;t have to go to middle school, I can stay right here. But not in your class. In someone else&#x2019;s class where the teacher and all the kids will soon grow to hate me</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dismissal bell interrupts Mrs. Funkhauser. I leap from my seat and run. The first kid out the door, that&#x2019;s me. Down the steps, across the street, getting a head start. Behind me, I hear Jon Owens shout, &#x201c;Run, Brenda, run!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He and his friends chase me for maybe a block, calling me a girl, a weirdo, a long-haired freak, but they can&#x2019;t catch me. I&#x2019;m the fastest runner in school, mainly because I&#x2019;ve had a lot of practice eluding Jon.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day I walked into Mrs. Funkhauser&#x2019;s classroom, he and the other kids have hated me because of my hair and my attitude. Weird is what they call me. Weird is what I am. I don&#x2019;t belong anywhere and I don&#x2019;t care. I might be only twelve years old, but I know you can&#x2019;t trust anyone. Sooner or later, they&#x2019;ll desert you, betray you, turn against you, and you&#x2019;ll end up alone. If a foster kid learns anything after moving from house to house and school to school, it&#x2019;s <i>Don&#x2019;t even try to make friends</i>.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I no longer hear Jon and his friends behind me, I don&#x2019;t slow down. Somehow I&#x2019;ve ended up in the old part of town, in a bad neighborhood, on a street of big houses chopped up into apartments. Gang tags and graffiti cover street signs and stop signs, telephone poles, walls, and fences. Men linger in groups on corners. Women sit on porch steps, smoking and keeping an eye on their kids. Broken-down cars with their hoods up are parked along the street.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely don&#x2019;t belong here, so I keep running, taking care not to look at anyone in case I offend them. Heading toward Main Street, I cut through an out-of business convenience store&#x2019;s parking lot. That&#x2019;s when I make a major mistake. I look back to make sure nobody&#x2019;s following me and run right into a big Harley Davidson bike parked behind the boarded-up store. It falls over with the loud noise of metal crashing onto asphalt. I fall with it, cutting my hand on broken glass. Scrambling to my feet, I see the owner of the bike running toward me, cursing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I groan with despair. I&#x2019;ve knocked over Sean Barnes&#x2019;s bike and I&#x2019;m done for. Shouting a useless apology, I turn to run, but I&#x2019;m not fast enough. Sean grabs a handful of my hair in his fist and jerks me to a stop. My eyes water with pain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry, I didn&#x2019;t see it, I didn&#x2019;t mean to,&#x201d; I babble in a high voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&#x2019;t let go of my hair. &#x201c;You know who I am?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mouth is dry with fear, but I manage to nod. Everybody in East Bedford knows who Sean Barnes and his friends are. They&#x2019;ve all been in and out of juvenile detention since they were my age, maybe even younger. They get into knife fights, they break into houses, they deal drugs in the dark corners of the McDonald&#x2019;s parking lot. Kids say they run a meth lab in an abandoned factory out on Muncaster Road. Everybody is scared of them, even grownups. To hear people talk, they&#x2019;re responsible for every crime in town.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just last night, Mrs. Clancy, my foster so-called mother, read the local paper&#x2019;s crime log out loud. &#x201c;Jewelry store in the mall robbed, three houses broken into, car stolen, homeless man assaulted in town park,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;all by person or persons unknown&#x2014;Sean Barnes, in other words. He should be locked up. Not out walking the streets, stealing cars and beating up helpless old men. I won&#x2019;t go near that park. Even in the middle of the day, it&#x2019;s not safe.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now here I am in a deserted parking lot behind a boarded-up store. Not a person in sight, and even if there were they&#x2019;d look the other way. Sean has a tight grip on my hair, and two of his friends have joined him. I know their names too&#x2014;Gene Cooper and T.J. Wasileski&#x2014;as big and mean and scary as Sean. They&#x2019;re both grinning at the sight of me, their day&#x2019;s entertainment, the star of the show.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What do you mean knocking my bike over, you screwed-up little punk?&#x201d; Sean shoves his face close to mine and breathes cigarettes and beer in my face. His teeth are yellow. He has acne scars. And sleeve tattoos on both arms. &#x201c;You need a haircut real bad,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;You look like a girl. But a whole lot uglier.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to yank free, but he holds tight to my hair. &#x201c;You got a gender problem or something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;We can help him with that,&#x201d; T.J. says. &#x201c;One flick of a knife and he becomes a she.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrapping my hair around his fist, Sean shoves me down on the asphalt so I&#x2019;m face to face with the Harley. &#x201c;See these scratches?&#x201d; He yanks my hair hard. My nose bangs against the bike&#x2019;s wheel. &#x201c;See where the paint&#x2019;s chipped? You did that, you little freak.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean to knock your bike over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Is that all you got to say?&#x201d; T.J. nudges me hard with the toe of his boot and my nose hits the wheel again. Blood drips and spatters on the asphalt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still gripping my hair, Sean yanks me to my feet. &#x201c;Ah, look, ugly girl&#x2019;s nose is bleeding. And he&#x2019;s crying.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You owe Sean some respect.&#x201d; Gene kicks my feet out from under me, and for a painful second I hang by my hair.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean opens his fist and lets me fall. I start to get up, but he pushes me down. &#x201c;Stay on your knees and apologize.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I mutter. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see the bike. It was an accident.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe his hair was in his eyes,&#x201d; T.J. says. &#x201c;Want I should chop it off?&#x201d; He flourishes a hunting knife. The sunlight bounces off the blade like sparks of fire. I&#x2019;m so scared, my insides are melting.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sean pulls me up and shoves me toward T.J. T.J. shoves me toward Gene, Gene shoves me back to Sean. They&#x2019;re laughing, but each time they push me they push harder. Round and round I go between the three of them, faster and faster. I&#x2019;m dizzy, I stagger, almost fall but they catch me and keep up the game.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, as quickly as it began, it ends. Sean lets me fall and stands there looking down at me. The sun is in my eyes and I can&#x2019;t see his face. He reaches into his pocket and I flinch, expecting to see a knife. He pulls out a pack of cigarettes instead and lights one, flicking the match at me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Girl,&#x201d; he sneers. &#x201c;Messed-up long-haired freak. Something like this happens again, I&#x2019;ll give you more than a bloody nose.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three of them get on their bikes and roar away, laughing. I scramble to my feet. The parking lot is empty, they&#x2019;re gone, and all that&#x2019;s left is my sore scalp, still burning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>El Malpais, Mt.

This was the exciting time when the factories of Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors competed against each other under the slogan, &#34;Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.&#34; Author Larry Davis experienced the period firsthand from the driver&#39;s seat, as he competed in various Stock and Super Stock categories between 1960 and 1970. Read this completely illustrated, year-by-year history of Super Stock racing from 1955 to 1968, including first-person accounts of action from match races to the Nationals, and appendices featuring all major event winners, NHRA rules, and the engine/chassis combinations.</p><p>Without a doubt, the most popular classes in drag racing are the feature cars that the Average Joe has a chance to drive and afford. In the early and mid-60s, this era was especially interesting as the cars that people were racing were muscle cars right off the showroom floor. Super Stock takes a look at what was the most popular class of drag racing - factory Super Stock. It traces the evolution of the cars, the engines, the rules, the personalities, and many of the teams, from its beginnings in the mid-1950s through to the 1960s and the era of the Super Stock 409s, Ramchargers, 421 Pontiacs, and 406 Fords. This was a time when Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors competed on a weekly basis at local drag strips throughout the country, and the saying &#x201c;...win on Sunday, sell on Monday...&#x201d; had real significance in the marketplace. This is also the period that saw emergence of the term &#x201c;musclecar&#x201d; and the production of a whole class of American automobiles - which are now the most sought after by collectors, restorers, and performance enthusiasts. This affordable edition of Super Stock: Drag Racing the Family Sedan is a paperback release of the original best -selling hardcover edition. It includes all the same first-person accounts of what drag racing was really like in the early 1960s, how the manufacturers controlled the competition and the results of the races, and how the sanctioning bodies attempted to control the manufacturers, who in turn simply sidestepped the rules. Appendices include all of the major event winners and the rules defining the classes as well as information detailing the engines and chassis competing in Top Stock categorieLarry Davis was a hobby drag racer between 1960 and 1970, competing in various Stock Modified Production and Super Stock classes. He participated in the 1967 and 1969 NHRA National Championships in Indianapolis, IN.</p><h2>Twist: Yoga Poems</h2><p><b>Come explore yoga in a new way with <i>TWIST</i>,</b><br> a collection of sixteen original poems sure to inspire even the youngest yogi!

Visit her online at JuliePaschkis.com.Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;This collection of 16 poems touches on the uplifting and emotional aspects of yoga, putting words to the spirit of the poses and evoking the energy and feelings of the practice. Wong's simple verses read almost like haiku, using imagery to get to the essence of the positions, rather than teaching how to perform them. On each spread, Paschkis's watercolor paintings frame both the poem and a child performing the pose with colorful fauna, flora, and people that suggest India as well as that particular exercise. The youngsters are varied ethnically though all wear clothing with Indian colors and patterns. The words and images blend together effortlessly, with energy and beauty. A few minor concerns: Tree pose should never be done with the foot directly on the knee as shown in the illustrations. Handstand shouldn't be done with the head on the floor and is a dangerous pose for children to try without direction. However, this is not an instruction book and readers should be directed to resources such as Baron Baptiste's <i>My Daddy Is a Pretzel</i> (Barefoot, 2004) to learn the actual poses. A simple author's note provides added encouragement for novices. Lovely to listen to and to look at, <i>Twist</i> is sure to inspire some new yogis.&#x2014;<i>Susan Oliver, Tampa-Hillsborough Public Library System, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But though he is a songwriter of exceptional depth - "Crazy" was one of his early classics - Willie only found success after abandoning Nashville and moving to Austin, Texas.<br><br><i>Red Headed Stranger </i>made country cool to a new generation of fans. <i>Wanted: The Outlaws </i>became the first country album to sell a million copies. And "On the Road Again" became the anthem for Americans on the move. A craggy-faced, pot-smoking philosopher, Willie Nelson is one of America's great iconoclasts and idols.<br><br>Now Joe Nick Patoski draws on over 100 interviews with Willie and his family, band, and friends to tell Nelson's story, from humble Depression-era roots, to his musical education in Texas honky-tonks and his flirtations with whiskey, women, and weed; from his triumph with #1 hit "Always On My Mind" to his nearly career-ending battles with debt and the IRS; and his ultimate redemption and ascension to American hero</p><p>Joe Nick Patoski has been writing about Willie Nelson for a number of publications including No Depression, Texas Monthly, Rolling Stone, Country Music, TV Guide, Picking Up the Tempo and the Austin American-Statesman. The co-author and author of biographies of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Selena and a contributor to the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll and Conjunto, Patoski lives in the Texas Hill Country near the village of Wimberley.Joe Nick Patoski has here conjured a biography that by far transcends its subject, a book whose evocations of time, place, and spirit are as masterful as they are enthralling.&#x2015;<b>Nick Tosches</b><br><br>Based on scores of interviews (including with Nelson himself), it's a lively, substantive account, closer to the treatment given a world-historical figure than a laid-back guitar picker. With <em>Willie Nelson: An Epic Life, </em>Patoski has written a fine book worthy of Willie.&#x2015;<b><i>Houston Chronicle</i></b><br><br>Veteran author and music writer Joe Nick Patoski spent enough time around Nelson and his friends to fill a few dozen chapters of "Willie Nelson: An Epic Life" and still leave us wanting more.&#x2015;<b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><br>Patoski tells wonderful stories, infusing his narrative with rich detail illustrating Willie's artistic development and its roots in his family's pre-Texas years in Arkansas.&#x2015;<b><i>Austin-American Stateman</i></b><br><br>Nelson fans will have their blue eyes cryin' in the rain-with joy-over the arrival of such a richly report bio. There are scores of funny firsthand stories in his account of how a ramshackle hillbilly career sparked an unlikely convergence of redneck, hippie, and Hollywood culture.&#x2015;<b><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br><br>A mind-bogglingly thorough biography,&#x2015;<b><i>The Village Voice</i></b><br><br>"Excellent... Seamlessly weaves together the good, the bad and the ugly to form a three-dimensional portrait of the singer.... For Nelson, his hit 1980 single 'On the Road Again' isn't just a silly song he wrote for the movie Honeysuckle Rose--it's literally the story of his life. And Patoski has fleshed it out beautifully.&#x2015;<b><i>Rolling Stone</i></b><br><br>A freelance writer with a strong interest in Texas and its music, he seems to have tracked down every song Nelson ever wrote, every engagement he ever played, every recording he ever made, and so far as I can tell he has left out absolutely nothing.&#x2015;<b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>Patoski pulls together a rich narrative that keenly comprehends Nelson's artistic and geographical perambulations. The author is especially fine in the early going, colorfully recalling Willie's many years on the beer-joint circuit and the cast of sketchy characters who trod those hardwood floors. But Nelson doesn't get any free passes: Patoski dwells in depth on his capriciousness, quick temper, hard-partying lifestyle, infidelities and four tempesturous marriages, as well as his headline-making '90s tax case. The result is a warm, honest portrait of a compulsively footloose, restless artist at home in any musical style ... and truly at home only on his tour bus.<br><br> Patoski's profound understanding of Nelson's life, character and milieu make this the Willie bio to get.&#x2015;<b><i>Kirkus (starred review)</i></b><br><br>For a guy who isn't me, Joe Nick Patoski can really write. <em>Willie Nelson: An Epic Life </em>is heartbreaking enough to have been ghostwritten by Hank Williams. It may be the best book ever written about the life of Texas's greatest gift to the world.&#x2015;<b>Kinky Friedman</b></p><h2>Eve: The Awakening</h2><p>Eve is an outcast. A chimera.

I rummaged around for it in my purse while I was browsing the aisles of Target. The grin taking over my entire face was completely uncontrollable. I just couldn&#x2019;t help it. Talking with him&#x2014;seeing him&#x2014;was always the highlight of my day.</p><p>Running my thumb across the screen, I clicked the icon where his message waited. I&#x2019;d never even heard of the app until he&#x2019;d convinced me I <i>had</i> to get it, teasing me that I was living in the Stone Age, which to him I was pretty sure would date all the way back to 2011. I couldn&#x2019;t begin to keep up with all the tech stuff he loved.</p><p>I held my finger down on the new unread Snapchat message from gamelover745.</p><p>An image popped up on the screen, his face all contorted in the goofiest expression, pencils hanging from both his nostrils as he bared his teeth. I choked over a little laugh. The joy I felt every time I saw his face was almost overwhelming as it merged with the twinge of sorrow that tugged at my chest.</p><p>Quickly I shoved the feeling off. He told me he couldn&#x2019;t stand for me to look at him or think of him with pity. I had to respect that. He was so much braver than me, because seeing him sick made me feel so weak.</p><p>I forced myself not to fixate on his bald head and pale skin, and instead focused on the antics of this playful boy. The little timer ran down, alerting me I had only five more seconds of the picture, so I quickly read the messy words he&#x2019;d scrawled across the image.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;m sexy and I know it.</i></p><p>On a muted giggle, I shook my head, and I didn&#x2019;t hesitate for a second to lift my phone above my head to snap my own picture. Going for my silliest expression, I crossed my eyes and stuck my tongue out to the side.</p><p>So maybe the people milling around me in the middle of the busy store thought I was crazy, or some kind of delusional narcissist, but nothing inside me cared. I&#x2019;d do anything to see him smile.</p><p>I tapped the button so I could write on the picture.</p><p><i>Love you, goofball.</i></p><p>I pushed SEND.</p><p>Seconds later, my phone chimed again. I clicked to receive his message. This time he was just smiling that unending smile, sitting cross-legged in the middle of his bed, radiating all his beauty and positivity, and that sorrow hit me again, only harder.</p><p><i>Love you back, </i>he&#x2019;d written on the image<i>.</i></p><p>Letting the timer wind down, I clutched my phone as I cherished his message for the full ten seconds before our Snap expired. The screen went blank. I bit at the inside of my lip, blinking back tears.</p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t,</i> I warned myself, knowing how quickly I could spiral into depression, into a worry I couldn&#x2019;t control, one that would taint the precious time I had with him.</p><p>Sucking in a cleansing breath, I tossed my phone back into my purse and wandered over to the cosmetics section, browsing through all the shades and colors of lip gloss. I tossed a shimmery clear one into my cart, then strolled into the shampoo aisle.</p><p>Apparently I was in no hurry to get home. It was sad and pathetic, yet here I was, twenty-three years old and passing away my Friday night at Target.</p><p>Ben had texted me earlier saying he was going out to grab a beer with the guys and not to wait up for him. All kinds of warning bells went off in my head when I realized that his leaving me alone for the night only filled me with an overwhelming relief. That realization hurt my heart, because he&#x2019;d always been good to me, there for me when I was broken and needed someone to pick up the pieces, making me smile when I thought I never would again.</p><p>But with Ben? There had always been something missing. Something significant.</p><p>That flame.</p><p>The spark that lights you up inside when <i>the one</i> walks into the room. You know the one, the one you can&#x2019;t get off your mind, whether you&#x2019;ve known him your entire life or he just barreled into it.</p><p>Was it wrong that I craved someone like that for myself?</p><p>Maybe I&#x2019;d be content with Ben if I had never felt the flame before. If I&#x2019;d never known what it was like to need and desire.</p><p>But I had. It&#x2019;d been the kind of fire that had raged and consumed, burning through me until there was nothing left but ashes. I&#x2019;d thought that love had ruined me until Ben came in and swept me into his willing arms.</p><p>He&#x2019;d taken care of me, a fact I didn&#x2019;t take lightly. I honored and respected it, the way Ben honored and respected me.</p><p>So maybe I never looked the same or felt the same after <i>he&#x2019;d</i> destroyed something inside me. But I&#x2019;d survived, and I forced myself to find satisfaction in that, willed it to make me stronger instead of feeble and frail.</p><p>I tossed a bottle of shampoo I really didn&#x2019;t need into my cart, but it smelled all kinds of good, like vanilla and the sweetest flower, and today I didn&#x2019;t feel like questioning my motives. In fact, I tossed in a bottle of body wash for good measure. I rarely treated myself, and I figured I deserved it. The last four years had been spent working my ass off, striving toward my elementary education degree at Arizona State University, and I&#x2019;d finally landed my first real job a month ago.</p><p>Pride shimmered around my consciousness. Not the arrogant kind. I was just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. happy. Happy because of what I had achieved.</p><p>I bit the inside of my lip, doing my best to contain the ridiculous grin I felt pulling at my mouth.</p><p>Finally&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>finally</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;d attained something that was all on me.</p><p>Ben was always the one who took care of me. But he also had a bad habit of taking all the credit. Like my life would fall apart without him in it.</p><p>Slowly, I wound my way up toward the registers. I needed to get out of here before I drained what little I had in my checking account with all my <i>celebrating</i>.</p><p>I rolled my eyes at myself and squashed the mocking laughter that rolled up my throat.</p><p><i>Yep, livin&#x2019; large and partyin&#x2019; hard.</i></p><p>My life was about as exciting as Friday-night bingo at the retirement home down the street.</p><p>But hey, at least my hair would smell good and my lips would taste even better.</p><p>Scanning the registers, I hunted for the shortest line, when my eyes locked on a face that was so familiar, but just out of reach of my recognition. Curiosity consumed me, and I found I couldn&#x2019;t look away.</p><p>She was standing at the front of her cart, her attention cast behind her. Obviously searching for someone.</p><p>I stared, unabashed, craning my head to the side as I tried to place the striking green eyes and long black hair. She was gorgeous, enough to make any supermodel feel self-conscious, but she was wearing the kind of smile that spoke a thousand welcomes.</p><p>Two feet in front of her, I came to a standstill, which only caused her warm smile to spread when her gaze landed on me. My attention flitted to the empty infant car seat that was latched onto the basket, then darted back to her face. My stomach twisted into the tightest knot as recognition slammed me somewhere in my subconscious, my throat growing dry when her name formed in my head before it swelled on my tongue. &#x201c;Aly Moore?&#x201d; I managed, everything about the question timid and unsure. Well, I wasn&#x2019;t unsure it was her. There was no question, no doubt.</p><p>What I wasn&#x2019;t so sure about was whether I should actually stop to talk to her. My heart was already beating a million miles a minute, like a stampeding warning crashing through my body, screaming at my limbs to go and go now.</p><p>Still, I couldn&#x2019;t move. Short gusts of sorrow were a feeling I was well accustomed to, dealing with Stewart and all the sadness his illness brought into my life.</p><p>But this?</p><p>Pain constricted my chest, pressing and pulsing in, and I struggled to find my absent breath.</p><p>God, she looked just like <i>him</i>. I always did my best to keep him from my thoughts, all the memories of him buried deep, deep enough to pretend they&#x2019;d forever been forgotten, when in reality, everything I&#x2019;d ever shared with him was unrelentingly vivid.</p><p>Seeing her brought them all flooding back.</p><p>His face.</p><p>His touch.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block them out, but they only flashed brighter.</p><p><i>God.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Samantha Schultz.&#x201d; My name tumbled from her mouth as if it came with some kind of relief. She stretched out her hand, grasping mine. &#x201c;Oh my gosh, I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s you. How are you?&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t seen her in years. Seven, to be exact. She was only two years younger than me, and she&#x2019;d always been a sweet girl. Sweet <i>and</i> smart. Different in a good way, quiet and shy and bold at the same time. I&#x2019;d always liked her, and some foolish part of me had believed she&#x2019;d always be a part of my life. I guess I&#x2019;d taken that for granted, too.</p><p>But that&#x2019;s what happens when you&#x2019;re young and naive and believe in promises that turn out only to be given in vain.</p><p>I swallowed over the lump in my throat and forced myself to speak. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been good. It&#x2019;s so great to see you.&#x201d; It was all a lie wrapped up in the worst kind of truth.</p><p>I dropped my gaze, my eyes landing on the diamonds that glinted from her ring finger where she grasped my hand, and I caught just a peek of the intricate tattoo that was woven below the ring, like she&#x2019;d etched a promise of forever into her skin.</p><p>A war of emotions spun through me, and I wanted to fire off a million questions, the most blatant of them jerking my attention between the empty infant carrier and her ring. My mind tumbled through a roller coaster of memories as it did its best to catch up to the years that had passed.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh my God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#x2019;re married? And you&#x2019;re a mom.&#x201d; I drew the words out as I finally added up the obvious, and a strange sense of satisfaction at seeing her grown up fell over me. It seemed almost silly, thinking of her that way, considering she was only two years younger than me. Now the years separating our ages didn&#x2019;t seem like such a big deal. Not the way they had then, when I&#x2019;d thought of her as just a little girl, a hundred years and a thousand miles behind me. It seemed now she&#x2019;d flown right past me.</p><p>With my words, everything about her glowed. She held up her hand to show me the ring I&#x2019;d just been admiring, her voice soft with a reverent awe. &#x201c;Can you believe it?&#x201d; She laughed quietly. &#x201c;Some days I can&#x2019;t believe it myself.&#x201d;</p><p>The joy filling her was so clear, and I chewed at my bottom lip, both welcoming the happiness I felt for her and fighting the jealousy that slipped just under the surface of my skin. Never would I wish any sorrow on her, or desire to steal her happiness away because I didn&#x2019;t have it myself. I wasn&#x2019;t vicious or cruel. But seeing her this way was a stark reminder of what I was missing.</p><p>Happiness.</p><p>I bit back the bitter feeling, searching for an excuse to get away, because I was finished feeling sorry for myself, when Aly&#x2019;s face transformed into the most radiant smile, her attention locked somewhere behind me. There was nothing I could do but follow her gaze. I looked over my shoulder.</p><p>All the surprise at finding Aly Moore amplified, spinning my head with shock when I saw who she was staring at.</p><p>Jared Holt strode toward us.</p><p>My knees went weak.</p><p>The grown man was completely covered in tattoos, every edge of him hard and rough. But none of the surprise I felt was caused by the way he looked, because I&#x2019;d been there to watch his downward spiral. Part of me was surprised to see he was still alive.</p><p>He held an adorable, tiny baby girl protectively against his chest, the child facing out as they approached. She kicked her little legs when she caught sight of her mom. A soft smile pulled at his mouth and warmth flared in his eyes when they landed on Aly.</p><p>My heart did crazy, erratic things, and the small sound that worked up my throat was tortured. Someone was trying to pull a sick joke on me, dangling all the bits of my past right in front of my face.</p><p>It just had to be Jared.</p><p>No, he hadn&#x2019;t been responsible for any of the choices Christopher or I had made. Still, he&#x2019;d been the catalyst that had driven the confusion.</p><p>The overwhelming feeling rushing over me was altogether cruel and welcome at the same time, because God, how many times had I lain awake at night, unable to sleep because I was thinking of Christopher Moore, wondering where he was and who he&#x2019;d become? And suddenly here was his world, our world, his sister and his best friend, the people who had been with us and were part of what defined that time&#x2014;standing in front of me at Target with their little baby girl.</p><p>Aly must have sensed my panic. Again she reached out to squeeze my hand. &#x201c;You remember Jared Holt, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; She obviously knew I did. There was no missing the look that passed between the two of them, a secret conversation transpiring in a glance.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I whispered hoarsely.</p><p>&#x201c;Samantha,&#x201d; Jared said as a statement. He handed Aly the little tube of diaper rash ointment he must have gone in search of while she waited at the front of the store. He turned his attention right back to me. &#x201c;God&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it&#x2019;s been years.

Yet, despite its outstanding reputation, the region has remained relatively closed to consumers, as forbidding as the highest ch�teau gates or the most tannic of its young wines. In this highly approachable, beautifully illustrated guide, Master of Wine James Lawther draws on his insider&#x2019;s knowledge to open up Bordeaux. He has identified 90 producers from both the Left and Right banks with the finest wines and the most interesting stories to tell and takes us inside their chateaux, offering intimate portraits of both the properties and the people who shape this fascinating region. He also provides chapters on history and winemaking that explain how Bordeaux has risen over the past three centuries to the unparalleled status it enjoys today. Illustrated throughout with original photographs and detailed color maps, <i>The Finest Wines of Bordeaux </i>reveals a changing region that is more open to new producers than its insular reputation suggests and one that continues to hold a tight grip on the imaginations of wine enthusiasts around the world.</p><p>James Lawther MW is a wine writer who has been based in Bordeaux since 1995. He is a contributing editor of <i>Decanter</i>, a contributor to <i>The World of Fine Wine,</i> author of <i>The Heart of Bordeaux</i>, and a contributor to several wine books including the <i>Global Encyclopedia of Wine.</i>&#x201c;Follows a brief overview of the regions&#x2019; history, climate, soil, viticulture, and wine making with geographically divided snapshots of info for each ch�teau.&#x201d; STARRED REVIEW (<i>Library Journal</i> 2010-08-01)<br><br>&#x201c; Takes a remarkably fresh look at an area often treated with fustiness and boredom.

If YES, then STOP. You will probably not like the book. If NO (i.e., you like the Sheldon character), then continue. Do you have strong opinions about how a character with Asperger&#39;s should behave? If YES, then STOP. I&#39;ve read some reviews by people who felt that the protagonist, Don Tillman, is unbelievable because he does things and responds to things in ways that someone with Asperger&#39;s wouldn&#39;t do. (I don&#39;t want to say what those things are, because it could be spoiler-y.) If NO, then continue. (I do want to note that it&#39;s never stated explicitly that Don has Asperger&#39;s. Certainly he is lacking in social skills, has everything in his life organized and analyzed for maximum efficiency, and emotions are troublesome for him. But I don&#39;t think there is some kind of pattern book that people with Asperger&#39;s have to follow. I just looked at Don as an individual, and went with the flow of the book.) Do you enjoy quirky, whimsical humor and romantic comedy? If NO, then STOP. If yes, then continue to the &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature on Amazon&#39;s product page, go to Chapter 2 and read the description of Don&#39;s talk &#34;Genetic Precursors to Autism Spectrum Disorders.&#34; Just that couple of pages should tell you all you need to know, finally, about whether this will be a good reading choice for you. I got a big kick out of the book. It&#39;s just a bouncy, character-driven story, and a feel-good romantic comedy. But NOT chick lit; my husband thought it was one of the most entertaining books he&#39;s read in quite awhile.

When a series of magical attacks disrupts the school, Doctor Ambrosius calls upon alumnus Mark Rider to secure the campus--and start training the students for war. The only student without magic, Spirit doesn't trust Mark or his methods. She knows that Oakhurst isn't safe.

The Accident. Her first Christmas without Mom and Dad and her baby sister, Phoenix. As she lay there half asleep, Spirit expected to feel the thump of Fee bouncing down on her bed and demanding she get up right now, it was Christmas, come on. And that would never happen again, because on a summer night less than a year ago, her sister and her parents had died in an accident that never should have happened. That alone was enough to make Spirit want to burrow into the covers of this bed and sleep until New Year&#x2019;s Day. At least. But adding to her sense of dislocation was where she was. If someone had told her this was where she&#x2019;d be twelve months ago, Spirit would have laughed in their face.<br>The middle of Montana was a place so unlike her Indiana home that she could have been on another planet. And she was living at Oakhurst Academy: a luxurious boarding school&#x2014;an <i>orphanage</i>&#x2014;that invested more money just in sports equipment than most people made in a year. But the most unbelievable thing of all was what Oakhurst taught, and <i>who</i> the school taught, and why she was here.<br>Oakhurst taught <i>Grammery</i>&#x2014;magic. And the only people who were allowed to attend Oakhurst were future magicians. <i>Orphaned</i> future magicians.<br>But Oakhurst was no happy, cozy place that nurtured young wizards and witches with feasts and magical competitions and quirky living quarters. Oh no. Being at Oakhurst was like being in one of those teen slasher movies where only the most competitive survived. And she meant that literally&#x2014;because some of her classmates <i>hadn&#x2019;t</i> survived.<br>Only three days ago, she and the few friends she&#x2019;d managed to make here&#x2014;Oakhurst didn&#x2019;t want its students to make friends or keep them&#x2014;had managed to defeat the evil force that had been killing Oakhurst students for almost forty years. And no one had realized this was going on, because everyone&#x2014;well, all the students anyway&#x2014;had just assumed that the missing kids ran away, or got too sick for the Oakhurst medical facilities to treat, or were sent away for some other reason. Until Spirit arrived at Oakhurst, no one had counted up the missing and come up with the truly scary total that she and her friends had.<br>The five of them shouldn&#x2019;t even have realized anything was wrong. Everything about Oakhurst, Spirit had realized, was designed to distract you, to make you come up with some sort of plausible explanation instead of looking for the real truth. Spirit wasn&#x2019;t really sure what had made them look past the convenient smoke screen. Was it because she and Loch were new here? Was it because one of the kids who vanished had been a friend of Muirin&#x2019;s?<br>Was it because she, Spirit White, didn&#x2019;t have the magic powers every other kid here had? The teachers&#x2014;and Doctor Ambrosius&#x2014;told her she did. They&#x2019;d told her that <i>her magic</i> was why she was here.<br>At least Burke had said that everybody&#x2019;s magic didn&#x2019;t show up at the same time. He was being kind&#x2014;Spirit knew that&#x2014;but at least not having magic had one advantage. Everybody who <i>did</i> have magic could sense each others&#x2019; presence. It had been Loch who, knowing she didn&#x2019;t have magic, had used that to defeat the thing that had been killing Oakhurst students....<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br><i>As the sounds got closer, Spirit could see Jeeps, SUVs. The vehicles were rusted and burned out, as if they&#x2019;d come from some supernatural junkyard. Lashed to every grille or hood was a set of antlers: deer, elk, even moose, and each vehicle held passengers. Some leaned out the sides of doorless, roofless SUVs. Some stood in the beds of pickup trucks, whooping and hollering and urging the drivers onward. They were dressed in the ragged remains of hunting clothes&#x2014;hunter&#x2019;s orange and red-and-black buffalo plaids and woodland camo. Skeletal hands gripped roll bars and steering wheels and door frames. Eyeless skulls covered in tatters of rotting flesh gazed avidly toward their prey. Every single one of them was dead....</i><br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The Wild Hunt was supposed to be a myth, a folktale, a legend: a ghostly troop of riders&#x2014;a <i>hunt</i>&#x2014;that galloped across the sky, capturing or killing anyone it met. It hadn&#x2019;t been supposed to be real. Spirit wanted to think she and her friends&#x2014;Loch, Addie, Muirin, and Burke&#x2014;had actually managed to <i>destroy</i> the Wild Hunt, but she was pretty sure they hadn&#x2019;t. They couldn&#x2019;t possibly be that lucky.<br>At least they&#x2019;d made it go away. Spirit burrowed deeper under the covers, shivering at the memory. They&#x2019;d been crazy to try taking on the Hunt by themselves. It was a miracle they&#x2019;d won. And their reward for doing the impossible had been a pat on the head from Doctor Ambrosius, Oakhurst&#x2019;s headmaster.<br>And that was an odd thing that stood out even in the middle of the general weirdness that was Oakhurst. On the day she and Loch had arrived, Doctor Ambrosius had told them that they&#x2014;everyone here at Oakhurst&#x2014;had enemies, and that a final showdown was coming. That was why he brought all of them here after their parents died. That was why he was training them in magic.<br><i>So if that&#x2019;s true, wouldn&#x2019;t he be a little more</i> interested <i>in the fact that there is a band of ghosts or demons or elves running around outside his magical shields?</i><br>They&#x2019;d already figured out that the Hunt had been raiding on the campus as well as off it. Oakhurst was surrounded by an invisible magical barrier&#x2014;its wards&#x2014;that wouldn&#x2019;t allow anything that didn&#x2019;t &#x201c;belong&#x201d; at Oakhurst to come in. For the Hunt to be able to raid on campus&nbsp;...<br>There had to be someone <i>at</i> Oakhurst&#x2014;one of the teachers or one of the staff&#x2014;letting them in.<br>And they had no idea who that might be.<br><i>At least we&#x2019;re still alive to try to figure it out,</i> Spirit thought glumly. <i>That beats the alternative. I guess.</i><br>Then again, the alternative was Christmas at Oakhurst.<br>There were no real &#x201c;holidays&#x201d; here, only a few days in which they didn&#x2019;t have classes, and despite the fact that there was a town only a few miles away, the students here were as isolated as if they were in prison: no television, no Internet&#x2014;no junk food!&#x2014;and the only movies they could watch were on the &#x201c;approved&#x201d; list. The rules were relaxed&#x2014;just a little&#x2014;at the school dances. That seemed to satisfy most of the kids. It only made Spirit think of how much she&#x2019;d lost.<br><i>I hate this place,</i> she thought numbly. <i>And not because Doctor Ambrosius turned me into a mouse during my &#x201c;Welcome to Oakhurst&#x201d; interview, and not because I&#x2019;m the only one in the entire school who can&#x2019;t cast spells, and not just because even the teachers here are trying to kill all of us, and not even because I&#x2019;m pretty sure this whole place wants us to all hate each other. I hate it because they even turn the</i> holidays <i>into work.</i><br>The month of December had been packed not only with classes&#x2014;and everybody&#x2019;s course-load was brutal&#x2014;but with preparations for their so-called week of vacation. It wasn&#x2019;t really. There were a lot of requirements, like snow and ice sculptures, including a snow castle and a snow maze. You&#x2019;d think stuff like that would be just for fun, but it wasn&#x2019;t. It was a <i>course requirement</i> for the Water Witches, who were graded on <i>Grammery</i>, art, and architectural design.<br><i>Way to suck the fun out of playing in the snow, thankyew, thankyew very much,</i> Spirit thought mockingly.<br>The Water Witches weren&#x2019;t the only ones with &#x201c;vacation&#x201d; homework. The music classes rehearsed for a Christmas concert. The English classes rehearsed a play for New Year&#x2019;s Eve. The athletic teams practiced for yet another series of demonstrations and contests. And everybody rehearsed for Christmas Day, which included another of Oakhurst&#x2019;s hideous &#x201c;formal dinners.&#x201d; Even the carol-singing was mandatory.<br><i>Even if no one else is as depressed as I am, by the time today comes, everyone should be so sick of getting ready for it, all they&#x2019;ll want is for it to be over.</i><br>Suddenly Spirit&#x2019;s pillow was snatched off her head. She made a grab for it, but Muirin held it out of reach.<br>&#x201c;Up!&#x201d; the redhead commanded. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to miss breakfast!&#x201d;<br>Spirit responded by pulling her blanket over her head. &#x201c;Wake me when it&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;And you aren&#x2019;t supposed to go into somebody&#x2019;s room without permission,&#x201d; she added sulkily.<br>In reply, Muirin pulled the blanket off the end of the bed. Spirit yelped at the blast of cold air. Oakhurst believed that sleeping in cold bedrooms was good for you. Now she was completely awake, and there was no point in trying to out-stubborn Muirin. With a growl, she tossed back the covers, grabbed her robe, and stalked into her bathroom, shutting the door on Muirin&#x2019;s smug look of triumph.<br>She stalked out again a few minutes later, damp from her shower, and stomped into her closet. It was big enough to dress in&#x2014;her whole bedroom here had luxuries she&#x2019;d never imagined owning, like a flat-screen TV and her very own microwave&#x2014;and it was the same as every other student&#x2019;s. They all had private rooms, and their own computers, and&nbsp;...<br>Pretty much everything they wanted, except privacy, freedom, and their families back.<br>A few minutes later, she came out of the closet, dressed&#x2014;in an Oakhurst uniform, o...</p><h2>Hexes for the Modern Age: Contemporary Curses for the People Who Irritate You the Most</h2><p>Let&#x2019;s face it: most people irritate us. <i>Hexes for the Modern Age</i> is a tongue-in-cheek approach to giving these folks a taste of their own medicine.

When she broke with Rodin, who refused to marry her, she continued to sculpt, paint and exhibit. But in time, living in poverty and semi-obscurity, she destroyed some of her work, her friendships and family ties, and became "nothing more than an anxious shadow hiding in the recesses of her dark studio, asking only for silence and oblivion." In 1913, Paul Claudel had his reclusive, paranoid, now unattractive sister incarcerated, and she remained in sanatoriums for the rest of her life. Interweaving family letters, this brief biography by her grandniece is timed to appear with the opening of an exhibition of her work at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.

What if you were given that choice? We're talking actual life and death now. Your own life and death. What if a well-informed, trusted authority figure said you had to make difficult and enduring changes in the way you think, feel, and act? If you didn't, your time would end soon&#x2014;a lot sooner than it had to. Could you change when change mattered most?"</p><p>This is the question Alan Deutschman poses in <em>Change or Die</em>, which began as a sensational cover story by the same title for Fast Company. Deutschman concludes that although we all have the ability to change our behavior, we rarely ever do. In fact, the odds are nine to one that, when faced with the dire need to change, we won't. From patients suffering from heart disease to repeat offenders in the criminal justice system to companies trapped in the mold of unsuccessful business practices, many of us could prevent ominous outcomes by simply changing our mindset. </p><p>A powerful book with universal appeal, <em>Change or Die</em> deconstructs and debunks age-old myths about change and empowers us with three critical keys&#x2014;relate, repeat, and reframe&#x2014;to help us make important positive changes in our lives. Explaining breakthrough research and progressive ideas from a wide selection of leaders in medicine, science, and business (including Dr. Dean Ornish, Mimi Silbert of the Delancey Street Foundation, Bill Gates, Daniel Boulud, and many others), Deutschman demonstrates how anyone can achieve lasting, revolutionary change.</p><p><em>Change or Die</em> is not about merely reorganizing or restructuring priorities; it's about challenging, inspiring, and helping all of us to make the dramatic transformations necessary in any aspect of life&#x2014;changes that are positive, attainable, and absolutely vital.</p></p><p><p>Alan Deutschman is a senior writer at <em>Fast Company</em> and the author of two previous books, <em>The Second Coming of Steve Jobs</em> and <em>A Tale of Two Valleys</em>. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia, with his wife.</p>Brian Keeler�s narration of this cutting-edge advice on change couldn�t be more enjoyable or impressive. Pausing or quieting his voice for emphasis, he misses no nuance and conveys a natural engagement with the author�s analytic writing. After a hard-hitting and succinct introduction, Deutschman systematically explains nine facets of personal change. Integrating findings from a variety of disciplines, his strategies are innovative and seamlessly supported by riveting business stories. His stories and analysis stay close to the heart by encouraging continuous curiosity about the self.

Covering over a hundred outstanding films and offering nearly two hundred carefully chosen stills, this is by far the most thorough and entertaining study available of <i>noir</i> themes, visual motifs, character types, actors, and directors. Hirsch examines the features that make Burt Lancaster, Joan Crawford, Robert Mitchum, and Humphrey Bogart into <i>noir</i> icons; as well as the camera angles, lighting effects, and story lines that characterize the work of such major <i>noir</i> directors as Fritz Lag, Billy Wilder, and Orson Welles. With a complete list of credits to 112 films and a new introduction, Hirsch's work remains the classic analysis of the most original genre of American cinema.</p><p>Foster Hirsch, the author of fifteen books on film and theater, among them <i>The Dark Side of the Screen: Film Noir</i> and <i>Kurt Weill on Stage</i> , lives in New York City.&#34;Wonderfully readable: Hirsch is clear, knowledgeable, and concise...

It was a direct adaptation of the existing P-36 airframe to enable mass production of frontline fiighters with minimal development time. By the time production ceased in November 1944, 13,738 P-40s had been produced; they were used by the air forces of 28 nations and remained operational throughout the war. Warhawk was the name the US Army Air adopted for all models, British Commonwealth air forces gave the name Tomahawk to models equivalent to the P-40B/C and Kittyhawk to models equivalent to the P-40E and all later variants. This reissue features four new pages with color photographs and locations of &#39;Still Airworthy&#39; and &#39;On Display&#39;, modern examples of the P-40. Illustrated with more than 100 photos, 10 color profiles and line drawings. 64 pages.</p><p></p><h2>Letchworth State Park (Images of America)</h2><p>Letchworth State Park, now a century old, grew out of a generous donation made by William Pryor Letchworth to the State of New York. The park&#x2019;s remarkable history reaches back as far as the last ice age. From the Portage Gorge to the mighty highbanks at Mount Morris, Letchworth State Park follows the flow of the Genesee River, exploring the natural and human events that have shaped this inspiring landscape. Drawing on historical images and regional folklore from the collections of the authors, the park, and various local sources, the reader is invited into the past of a park that has been called the &#x201c;Grand Canyon of the East.&#x201d;</p><p>Thomas A.

Richens is a graduate of State University of New York at Geneseo and coauthor of Irondequoit, also in the Images of America series.Title: Publisher surprised by grand demand for Letchworth book<br><br>Author: Susan J. Conrad<br><br>Publisher: The Daily News<br><br>Date: 1/3/2009<br>Letchworth State Park is so popular that one book publisher is finding it a challenge to keep up with demand for its book about the "Grand Canyon of the East."<br>Arcadia Publishing, which has published more than 2,800 titles in its "Images in America" series, didn't expect so much interest in its Letchworth State Park book, said Lynn Ruggiere, public relations coordinator for the Mount Pleasant, S.C.-based publisher.<br>"We did sell out of Letchworth State Park in its first month, which we did intend to be enough copies to last a year," Ruggieri said. "The book has been reprinted twice, with the first reprint being the same amount as the original print run."<br>The photograph-filled book features a number of rarely-seen images from the park archives, the Castile Historical Society and private collections. One shows a horse-drawn wagon making its way along a perilously rough-hewn road along the edge of the valley. Another shows a Pennsylvania Railroad train running through the valley - on tracks removed about 45 years ago.<br>Published in April, Ann Burlingham of Burlingham Books in Perry, initially purchased 40 copies of the book.<br>"The book sold quickly, so I ordered 400 more copies," Burlingham said.<br>The store has now sold more than 300 copies, she said.<br>Present Tense in Batavia has also sold several copies of the book, said owner Erica Caldwell.<br>"It's a good seller, especially for only being out for a few months," Caldwell said. "We have not sold out because I initially bought enough from the publisher."<br>The book has exceeded the publisher's expectations, but Ruggieri said she cannot pinpoint one reason for that.<br>"The book seems to reach an emotional point with readers," Ruggieri said. "It is also authored by an exceptional group of four dedicated authors who have gone out of their way to make this book a success."<br>Authors Thomas A. Breslin, Thomas S. Cook, Russell A. Judkins and Thomas C. Richens set out to tell the park's story, focusing on lesser-known area of the park such as the former Genesee Valley Canal or the Smokey Hollow and St. Helena settlements.<br>Each man brought their own unique knowledge and expertise to the book. Breslin, 72, is a former manager of the park, having retired in 1992; Cook, a social studies teacher at Keshequa Central School, worked with Breslin to create the park's history program in 1978; Judkins, 63, is an anthropology professor at Geneseo State College, specializing in Iroquois and local folklore; and Richens, 37, is an anthropology student who co-authored "Irondequoit," a separate volume in Arcadia's Images of America series.<br>"I do expect the book to continue to do well," Ruggieri said. "People are still interested and still buying."<br>Burlingham noted Arcadia's book is not the only Letchworth-based book selling well at her store. Canyon Light: The Seasons of Letchworth State Park by Ray Minnick has sold more than 1,000 copies at her store. The book is a collection of Minnick's most popular photographs of the park, taken during all four seasons and featuring a variety of plants, wildlife and scenic vistas.</p><h2>The Story of Freginald</h2><p>His extraordinary adventures with other animals-including Leo the lion and Freddy the pig-involve a stirring battle, a weird mystery successfully solved by careful deduction, and some very comical misunderstandings between the bear and an elephant, and between a lion and a mouse.

In What&#39;s the Deal With Wicca? Steve Russo lays bare the spiritual roots of Wicca and exposes the deception inherent in the promises made by its practitioners. At the same time, he clarifies the teachings of Christianity and demonstrates that Christian faith and spirituality are the only true ways to address the very real needs in the lives of teenagers.</p><p>Steve Russo is the author of ten books and numerous magazine articles. He is also the featured speaker on the music video TV show &#34;24/SEVEN,&#34; host of the daily radio feature &#34;Real Answers,&#34; and cohost of Focus on the Family&#39;s weekly teen talk radio show &#34;Life on the Edge Live!&#34; Steve makes his home in Southern California.A lot of kids today feel like the Christian church isn't relevant to their daily lives. One of the problems is that they've bought into a religious experience rather than establishing a personal relationship with God. It's awesome when you can grasp the concept of having an actual relationship with the living God&#x2014;the God of all creation. That sets Christianity apart from any other religion. Also, a lot of teens fail to really understand the resurrection power of Jesus Christ. They want answers about life and they want to be challenged to make a difference in their world&#x2014;but they can't seem to find this in their churches. Some people even question if God really cares about them and what's going on in their life. They want to know where God was when their mother died of cancer or why their father lost his job and abandoned the family. One girl asked me where God was when she was gang-raped. Disappointment with God is real for a lot of kids today. Obviously, pain and suffering are part of life&#x2014;but it's still hard to handle. And in some situations, we may never know the reason why we experience some of the things that we do in life. <p>In other situations, leaders in the church have failed miserably at making the Christian faith clear and understandable to kids in need of answers for the problems they're dealing with. The lack of practically applying the Bible to everyday life has caused many kids to search elsewhere, including witchcraft, for help and hope. Unfortunately, some leaders and Bible teachers seem to be answering all the questions that no one's asking. </p><p>Wicca's got a very positive image in our society today. It's no longer some ridiculed set of beliefs based on superstition. Instead, it's become a mainstream religious system that many see as a valid alternative to an "outdated Christian faith." There are at least five major ways in which Wicca differs from Christianity and other religions: </p><p>worship of the goddess and god; </p><p>reverence for the earth; </p><p>acceptance of magick; </p><p>acceptance of reincarnation; </p><p>lack of proselytizing activities (trying to get someone to change their religious beliefs). [Scott Cunningham, The Truth About Witchcraft Today (St. Paul, MN: Llewellyn Publications, 1987), 62.] Wicca and witchcraft is popping up everywhere. You can find its influence in PC games, movies, music, prime-time TV shows, cartoons, and books. The number of Web sites on Wicca is growing, and there are even classes being offered online and in some public libraries. So why is Wicca so popular, especially with teens? </p><p>For many, Wicca's promise of personal power over others and the ability to control your own life seems irresistible&#x2014;even among some teens currently involved in the church. Wicca is admired for its sensitivity to the environment and is seen as the female-friendly religion in comparison to Christianity's supposedly male-dominated hierarchical system. And because Christianity is perceived as being judgmental and intolerant in today's society, it's easy to see Wicca's huge appeal. Wiccans feel like they belong without the baggage of having to look, walk, or talk a certain way. Plus, because Wicca rejects moral absolutes, a person's natural rebellious nature is appealed to. And it offers the chance to develop a personal self-styled religion. The bottom line is that Wicca offers its followers the ability to set things right on their own without having to rely on a God who doesn't seem to answer their prayers anyway. </p><p>So who's right? Emily, Andrew, and Melissa? Did Alexis and her friend somehow miss the point of Wicca and quit too soon? Does Christianity really offer the answers and power we need and want? How do we make sense out of life? </p><p>Wicca and Christianity both can't be right. Ultimately, you will have to decide which pathway is the right one for you to pursue. But remember to choose wisely and make sure that you honestly compare what Jesus teaches and what Wicca teaches. It's not good enough to just be sincere in your beliefs. Sincerity won't get you very far when it comes to your eternal destiny or making life work on planet Earth. Neither will it give you the power for living in a stress-filled, confusing world. Maybe you have friends who are into Wicca and you're trying to understand and help them. This book will help you to discover the truth about Wicca and its exploding popularity. </p><p>Examine the information in this book carefully. Don't be afraid to ask yourself the tough questions. Think about it logically. In the end, I hope that you'll discover the answers you're looking for to make sense out of this life and eternity. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Excerpted from: What's the Deal With Wicca by Steve Russo Copyright � 2005; ISBN 0764201360 Published by Bethany House Publishers Used by permission.

At the top of the heap is Al Capone... and Capone&#39;s most feared hitman is Michael O&#39;Sullivan, known to friends and enemies alike as the Angel of Death.</p><p>Max Allan Collins is the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Private Eye Writers of America, and the author of many books, including Road to Perdition, which became the Oscar winning film, and the Quarry novels, the basis for the hit TV series on CinemaxReaders can be forgiven if they believe there&#x2019;s nothing more to be done with &#x201c;Road to Perdition,&#x201d; the murderous tale of a mob kingpin, his favored hit man and the lengths each was willing to go to protect his son. After all, we&#x2019;ve already seen three treatments of this gritty noir story. First there was the 1998 graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins with art by Richard Piers Rayner. Next came the 2002 Sam Mendes-directed film starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman. And then came Collins&#x2019; novelization of the movie. But it turns out the publisher of the novelization chopped about 30,000 words from Collins&#x2019; text to keep it from straying from the film version. Now Brash Books, a publishing house founded by novelists Lee Goldberg and Joel Goldman, has restored the missing text and released the novel as Collins intended it. The result is a richer and more satisfying version of the tale, one that combines the swift pace of the graphic novel with the well-developed father-son relationships of Mendes&#x2019; movie &#x2014; and that includes both additional hard-boiled dialogue and more historical context for the Depression-era story set in Al Capone&#x2019;s Illinois. And Collins&#x2019; writing, always crisp and vividly visual, is at its best here in &#x201c;Road to Perdition: The New, Expanded Novel.&#x201d;</p><h2>Quebec Central Railway: From the St. Francis to the Chaudi�re</h2><p><p> Derek Booth's story of the Quebec Central Railway, serving the upper St. Francis and Chaudi�re River valley regions of southern Quebec for over 130 years. </p><p> The Quebec Central included links with Quebec City and Sherbrooke, providing through passenger service between those locations and points in the USA, including Boston. Much specialized passenger equipment for QCR's service was manufactured at the company's shops. Quebec Central continued to provide passenger service between Sherbrooke and Quebec City until 1965. </p><p> The book tells the story of the railway from its earliest beginnings in the 1860s, when local business people in Quebec and Sherbrooke sought to implement rail service in their region. The largest of Quebec's regional rail carriers, the QCR was also, for some period of time, one of Canada's most profitable systems. After the Depression, the QCR entered a long decline culminating in its abandonment in 1994. Its subsequent rebirth under new management in 2000 added yet another chapter to the history of the railway, this one as a short line. This most recent business incarnation of regional railways in Canada survived until 2006. </p><p> The Quebec Central Railway, from its beginnings to its reincarnation, was a model of innovation and adaptation in both its freight and passenger operations. The QCR was one of the very few regional carriers in Canada to manufacture a significant portion of its rolling stock in its own company shops, as well as one of the first to experiment with gas-electric passenger cars in the face of rising competition from automobiles in the 1920s. </p><p> Throughout its history, the QCR was primarily a resource railway whose freight traffic rested heavily on the forest and mineral sectors, particularly on asbestos products. With major market constrictions and production declines, asbestos contributed zero freight tonnage to the re-born Quebec Central. It was forest products that, from 2000, became the mainstay of the new Quebec Central, but economic events in 2006 caused declines in that industry that led once again to the shutdown of Quebec Central Railway. </p><p> While much of the Quebec Central's right-of-way, stations and other structures have disappeared, many still survive in altered form. These are detailed in an appendix devoted to the principal physical components of the system. Information is included on the conversion, in several locations, of the right-of-way from Rails to Trails, thus permitting hikers, cyclists and snowmobilers once again to travel the Quebec Central, albeit with a different means of locomotion. </p><p> Over 200 photographs, some in color, cover all aspects of the operation of the railway. These photos illustrate not only details of QCR rolling stock and operational scenes, but also (through the extensive photographic archival holdings in the Eastern Townships) a full record of the regional economic and social impacts of the railway in relation to mining, agriculture, manufacturing, forest industries and urban growth. </p></p><p><p> A retired Professor of Geography at Bishop's University, Sherbrooke, Quebec, Derek Booth is a historical geographer with a special interest in the roles that railways played in the creation of human and economic landscapes in Canada. A graduate of McGill University, he is a Quebecer with deep family roots in the Eastern Townships and in the Ottawa Valley. In addition to <i>Railways of Southern Quebec</i>, Volumes I and II, he has written and lectured extensively on transport issues in the Eastern Townships.

She inquires into the subterranean dispositions and quandaries of Kafka and Henry James. She discusses the difficulties inherent in the translation of great books, whether into film or into another language. <br><br>She explores what she calls "the selfishness of art" and courts controversy with her views on <b>The Diary of Anne Frank</b> and its transformation for the stage. Her reflections on the "rights of history" and the "rights of imagination" tap a profound concern for truth in regard to the Holocaust. She considers the shifting splendors of New York City, past and present. And she revisits her youth more deeply and with more feeling--and comedy--than ever before, in essays that reveal some of the formative experiences of her life as a writer. <br><br><b>Quarrel &amp; Quandary</b> is a literary event and a cause for celebration.</p><p>"True essayists," declares Cynthia Ozick, "rarely write novels." This pronouncement would seem to overlook a horde of ambidextrous types, from John Updike to Gore Vidal to Charles Baxter to Joyce Carol Oates--and, of course, Ozick herself. The author of three novels, she is also among our finest essayists, combining a Jamesian nose for moral nuance with some of the most playful and pugnacious prose in contemporary letters. And her fourth collection, <i>Quarrel &amp; Quandary</i>, contains some of her very best work. There are ardent considerations of particular authors, including W.G. Sebald, Franz Kafka, and Swedish modern Goran Tunstrom. But this time around, the author is even more intent on exploring the rhetorical minefield where art and politics overlap. Her introduction, in fact, is one long riff on the importance of being earnestly <i>engag�</i>, at the end of which Ozick manages to have her cake and eat it too: "Two cheers, then--when there is no choice--for being <i>engag�</i>; but three cheers and more for that other bravery, the literary essay, and for memory's mooning and maundering, and for losing one's way in the bliss of American prose...." <p> In three provocative pieces ("The Rights of History and the Rights of the Imagination," "The Posthumous Sublime," and "Who Owns Anne Frank?"), Ozick suggests that the Holocaust is almost--but not quite--impervious to literature. She's particularly angered by the morphing of Frank's diary into a mother lode of Broadway-style uplift, a transformation that "tampers with history, with reality, with deadly truth." Elsewhere, though, Ozick is less polemical, more willing to be dazzled by Roethke's radiance or Henry James's epistemological high beams. And it's not only specific artists but entire genres that win her awed and eloquent approval: </p><blockquote> When we say that poetry is strange, we mean not that it is less than intelligible, but exactly the opposite: poetry is intelligibility heightened, strengthened, distilled to the point of astounding us; and also made manifold. Metaphor is intelligibility's great imperative, its engine of radical amazement. </blockquote> At its best, Ozick's prose is equally, radically amazing. She may not always compel our agreement--the scolding she administers to W.G. Sebald, whom she clearly admires, is something of a puzzler--but her voice never ceases to register distinction and detail, emitting what she calls "the hum of perpetual noticing." Five cheers, then, for <i>Quarrel &amp; Quandary</i>. And by the way, might <i>Mooning &amp; Maundering</i> be a candidate for the author's next alliterative title? <i>--James Marcus</i>"Her best collection to date."<br>--<i>The Boston Globe<br><br></i>"I urge all lovers of American prose to read it...

She lived with her two sons, Aristides and Michael, and her husband George Demetrios, the sculptor, in a section of Gloucester, Massachusetts, called Folly Cove. Here she taught a class in design and from it emerged the Folly Cove designers, a group of internationally known professional artisans. She is the author of many classic children&#39;s picture books, including MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL and KATY AND THE BIG SNOW.Gr 1&#x2013;3&#x2014;First published in 1941, this Western tall tale has been repackaged and repurposed in red and green as a "Christmas classic." The text and striking black-and-white woodcut illustrations are virtually unchanged from the original, though the title has been slightly modified with the omission of "The Saga of the Stewy Stinker" as the subtitle. VERDICT Though the new format is larger and brighter, this selection is still best read individually or one-on-one because of the intricacy of the panels and the lively language meant for slightly older picture book readers.

So when an anonymous note warns, "Someone in this class is a witch," the students in 6B are nervous -- especially the boy who's just discovered that he can cast spells and the girl who was named after the most famous witch of all.<em>Witch Week</em> features the debonair enchanter Chrestomanci, who also appears in <em>Charmed Life, The Magicians of Caprona,</em> and <em>The Lives of Christopber Chant.</em>Someone in the class is a witch. At least so the anonymous note says. Everyone is only too eager to prove it is someone else -- because in this society, witches are burned at the stake.</p><p>Someone in 6B is a witch. And, in the alternate reality described in Diana Wynne Jones's <i>Witch Week</i>, that's not at all a good thing to be. Jones plunks her readers directly into the life of Larwood House, a school in a present-day England that's a lot like the world we know, except for one major difference: witches are everywhere, and they are ruthlessly hunted by inquisitors. With witty, erudite writing, Jones tells of the adventures of the class of 6B as they set about to discover who among them is a witch. Clearly it's not the popular Simon or the perfect Theresa. Could it be fat Nan or sluggish Charles? Mysterious Nirupam or shifty-eyed Brian? By the climax of the book (which, by the way, involves saving the world), being a witch has become a badge of honor rather than a mark of shame. <p> Jones skillfully and seamlessly switches from one point of view to another, creating a comic companion piece to <i>Lord of the Flies</i> as she shows with perfect understanding the way children torment each other--and save each other. She neatly interweaves the dramatic plot with knowing descriptions of school life, as when lumpen Nan warily observes the popular girls: "At lessons, she discovered that Theresa and her friends had started a new craze. That was a bad sign. They were always more than usually pleased with themselves at the start of a craze... The craze was white knitting, white and clean and fluffy, which you kept wrapped in a towel so that it would stay clean. The classroom filled with mutters of, 'Two purl, one plain, twist two....'" <i>Witch Week</i> is a hugely entertaining book that doesn't condescendingly beat children over the head with its humane message of acceptance. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p><p>In a career spanning four decades, award-winning author Diana Wynne Jones (1934&#x2012;2011) wrote more than forty books of fantasy for young readers.

Religious and biblical scholar Bart Ehrman makes the provocative case that many of our widely held beliefs concerning the divinity of Jesus, the Trinity, and the divine origins of the Bible itself are the results of both intentional and accidental alterations by scribes. </p><p> In this compelling and fascinating book, Ehrman shows where and why changes were made in our earliest surviving manuscripts, explaining for the first time how the many variations of our cherished biblical stories came to be, and why only certain versions of the stories qualify for publication in the Bibles we read today. Ehrman frames his account with personal reflections on how his study of the Greek manuscripts made him abandon his once ultra&#x2013;conservative views of the Bible.</p></p><p><p>Bart D. Ehrman is one of the most renowned and controversial Bible scholars in the world today. He is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and is the author of more than twenty books, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>How Jesus Became God; Misquoting Jesus; God&#x2019;s Problem; Jesus, Interrupted</em>; and <em>Forged</em>. He has appeared on <em>Dateline NBC, The Daily Show&nbsp;</em><em>with Jon Stewart, CNN, History</em>, and top NPR programs, as well as been featured in <em>TIME</em>, the <em>New York Times, The Washington Post, The New Yorker</em>, and other publications. He lives in Durham, North Carolina. Visit the author online at www.bartdehrman.com.</p>The popular perception of the Bible as a divinely perfect book receives scant support from Ehrman, who sees in Holy Writ ample evidence of human fallibility and ecclesiastical politics. Though himself schooled in evangelical literalism, Ehrman has come to regard his earlier faith in the inerrant inspiration of the Bible as misguided, given that the original texts have disappeared and that the extant texts available do not agree with one another. Most of the textual discrepancies, Ehrman acknowledges, matter little, but some do profoundly affect religious doctrine. To assess how ignorant or theologically manipulative scribes may have changed the biblical text, modern scholars have developed procedures for comparing diverging texts. And in language accessible to nonspecialists, Ehrman explains these procedures and their results. He further explains why textual criticism has frequently sparked intense controversy, especially among scripture-alone Protestants. In discounting not only the authenticity of existing manuscripts but also the inspiration of the original writers, Ehrman will deeply divide his readers. Although he addresses a popular audience, he undercuts the very religious attitudes that have made the Bible a popular book. Still, this is a useful overview for biblical history collections. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother.<p>Active in several organizations, Yolen has been on the Board of Directors of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1986 to 1988, is on the editorial board of several magazines, and was a founding member of the Western New England Storytellers Guild, the Western Massachusetts Illustrators Guild, and the Bay State Writers Guild. For twenty years, she ran a monthly writer's workshop for new children's book authors. In 1980, when Yolen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Our Lady of the Elms College in Chicopee, Massachusetts, the citation recognized that "throughout her writing career she has remained true to her primary source of inspiration--folk culture."

In 1306, a year has passed since patriot William "Braveheart" Wallace was executed, and things are not going well for the cause of Scottish freedom. Robert Bruce, newly crowned king of Scotland, has managed to evade his powerful enemy, Edward I of England, but many allies have been killed or taken. A recent capture is Bruce's 11-year-old daughter Marjorie. The princess finds herself conveyed to the English border town of Lanercost, locked in an iron cage, and displayed outdoors day and night by the decree of ailing King Edward, "Longshanks," himself. Marjorie's first-person narration of her captivity and the events leading up to it is exciting and moving, and her strategies for coping with a hideous imprisonment are models of ingenuity and staying true to oneself. The time line and afterword are helpful in understanding the historical context within which the authors place their well-wrought fictional tale.<br><i>Starr E.

Moscow was blanketed under a thick coat of snow. There were almost no cars about. His driver eased down ruined streets that made it look like a country still at war. The winter blizzards had begun before the rebuilding had gotten under way, and now it would have to wait for the thaw. Unfinished buildings stood frozen in time. Stores looked dark and uninviting, and appeared to offer little for sale. Even so, huge numbers of people gathered outside the shops and still more filled the crowded sidewalks, all carrying parcels. Most were poorly dressed, covered heads bent against the swirling white. Over twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died defeating the Nazis, nearly a third of the country&#x2019;s former wealth was gone, but Russia was already on the rebound. There were children everywhere. Babies&#x2014;so many babies&#x2014;bundled up within an inch of their lives against the bitter cold. Despite its drab appearance, the capital was alive and teeming with humanity. James Conant was a Yankee from hardy New England stock, but he had to admit he was impressed with the Russians. They were a tough race, tested by war, insurrection, and an unforgiving climate. &#x201c;There is no foolishness in this nation,&#x201d; he wrote in his diary. &#x201c;Nothing soft.&#x201d;<br> <br>As the embassy car approached the gates of the Kremlin, Conant peered up at the gloomy fortress-like complex on the Moskva River that was the seat of the Soviet government. Situated in the heart of old Moscow, bordered by Red Square to the east, and Alexander Garden to the west, it consisted of four palaces, four cathedrals, and some twenty towers enclosed within red turreted walls. The famous citadel had been the imperial residence of the czars for centuries, its opulent interior structures torn down and rebuilt on an ever-grander scale by a succession of monarchs until the Revolution of 1917. Even the Bolsheviks had been unable to resist the urge to glorify their rule. When Vladimir Lenin finally made it his headquarters, he stripped the golden eagles of the old regime from the towers and replaced them with the gleaming red stars of the new Communist order. Now the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin called the Kremlin home, and had chosen the savior&#x2019;s birthday to hold a reception in honor of his victorious allies. Since the atheist Soviet state had banned Christmas as a bourgeois tradition, however, the timing was not nearly as ironic for their host as it was for his guests.<br> <br>The dinner was held in a cavernous banquet hall. America&#x2019;s secretary of state, James Francis Byrnes, and Great Britain&#x2019;s foreign minister, Ernest Bevin, took their places on either side of Stalin, each flanked by a twelve-man delegation. The Soviet commissar of foreign affairs, Vyacheslav Molotov, was also in attendance, along with various members of the Politburo. The Russians aimed to impress: there were boats of caviar, smoked sturgeon, guinea hen, beef, and lamb and other delicacies, arrayed like a flotilla of silver down the long table, along with oceans of booze&#x2014;champagne, wine, brandy, and, of course, vodka. As soon as the guests were seated, the toasts began. According to custom, each course was preceded by a toast and a tumbler of vodka, which courtesy required be responded to in kind, toast for toast, drink for drink. One after another, the official toasts were drunk&#x2014;to their nations, peoples, armies, leaders, and innumerable government functionaries present that night. As each ponderous speech of welcome and good wishes had to be translated by an interpreter, even the short toasts seemed long. Conant, unused to so much alcohol, found it hard to relax. If one of the Russian officials were to drink to his health, he doubted his vodka-soaked brain would be able to formulate a suitable reply.<br> <br>He was still not sure what he was doing there. Two weeks earlier, he had stopped by his Washington office for a few hours when he received a call that the secretary of state was &#x201c;anxious to speak to him right away.&#x201d; When he reported to Byrnes&#x2019;s office, he was informed an emergency had arisen. The secretary was leaving for Moscow in two days&#x2019; time and wanted Conant to accompany him. The main purpose of the trip was to try to talk to the Russians about international control of the atomic bomb. Byrnes, a short, energetic man with sharp eyes, explained that he needed a bomb expert. Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, had fallen ill. Conant, the science administrator who along with Bush had led the Manhattan Project, and had been chiefly responsible for overseeing the development of the revolutionary new weapon, was an obvious choice. His distinguished war service, together with his stature as president of Harvard University, meant he would be able to argue effectively with the Soviet experts. Would he go?<br> <br>Conant was immediately intrigued by the prospect. He knew a great deal was at stake. Since the first bomb fell on Hiroshima in August of that year, America&#x2019;s atomic monopoly had divided their countries and cast a pall over postwar peace negotiations. Conant believed the only way to ensure peace was for the United States and the Soviet Union, which until very recently had been allies, to work out their differences and come to some arrangement regarding atomic energy and weapons of mass destruction. Even though it meant that the United States would have to give up its sole possession of the atomic &#x201c;secret,&#x201d; the internationalization of nuclear weapons and their production was the only way he could see to prevent an arms race. Nuclear intimidation was not the way to achieve national security. Having had a hand in unleashing this tremendous destructive force, Conant felt a strong obligation to help see it contained. No one understood better than he the need to outlaw the bomb&#x2019;s use in future conflicts, for that way led only to certain disaster and Armageddon.<br> <br>At the same time, he had no official standing. He was a scientist, not a politician. He had only just returned to Harvard full-time after a four-year absence during the war, and knew accepting another high-profile government assignment would infuriate the university trustees. By then, he had also spent enough time in Washington to worry about what he might be getting himself into by signing up for Byrnes&#x2019;s Moscow mission. There would be a price to pay, either way.<br> <br>After some deliberation, he decided he had no choice but to accede to the secretary of state&#x2019;s request. He rushed back to Boston and grabbed some winter clothes, and was back in Washington by Wednesday in time to leave with the American delegation from National Airport. They crossed the Atlantic in a special C-47 that was put at the secretary of state&#x2019;s disposal, overnighted in Frankfurt, and the next morning took off for Moscow via Berlin despite a warning that a front was closing in. They flew straight into the snowstorm, veering off course and getting lost. For a hair-raising hour or more, they flew blind, searching for lights&#x2014;any signs of human habitation&#x2014;while their fuel was running low. The decision was made that if the pilots could not find the city in the next ten minutes, they would have to turn back. Seconds later, the plane banked sharply, and Conant assumed they were headed for Berlin. Just then, the clouds parted, and the sprawling outskirts of Moscow came into view. Everyone let out a sigh of relief when they landed, even though it was the wrong airport. The Russian officials who met them kept asking why they had attempted such a risky flight. No one had an adequate answer.<br> <br>The hastily improvised Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was Byrnes&#x2019;s last-ditch effort at atomic diplomacy. For months, the Soviet leaders had done everything they could to frustrate his attempts to use America&#x2019;s monopoly on the bomb as leverage in the peace talks. The failure of Byrnes&#x2019;s gunslinger-style tactics at the Foreign Ministers Conference in London that fall had been an embarrassment. The negotiations had been fruitless. Rather than treat the bomb with the respect and fear Byrnes expected, the Russians had ridiculed the metaphorical bulge in his jacket in social gatherings while refusing to address it seriously in formal sessions. Stalin had feigned indifference, and issued a statement saying that it was only a weapon to frighten the weak-willed. Molotov, a master at subterfuge and delay, adopted the same line, and delighted in denigrating the bomb at every turn.<br> <br>President Harry Truman was losing faith in Byrnes, who had been dubbed Roosevelt&#x2019;s &#x201c;assistant president&#x201d; by the press, a title that did not sit well with his new boss. Even an old soldier like Henry Stimson, the outgoing secretary of war, warned that the bomb was a game changer, and it was a mistake to use it as a lever of pressure to extract internal political changes and the granting of individual liberties. Such changes took time, and the United States could not afford to delay reaching an agreement on the bomb. &#x201c;If we fail to approach them now,&#x201d; Stimson argued, &#x201c;and merely continue to negotiate with them, having this weapon rather ostentatiously on our hip, their suspicions and their distrust of our purposes and motives will increase.&#x201d; They could not afford to waste this chance at world peace.<br> <br>Desperate to reach some sort of compromise, and in the process score a diplomatic triumph that would redeem his reputation, Byrnes decided to take a more conciliatory approach. He would journey to the Soviet capital and take his case directly to Stalin. With luck, the home turf advantage would make the Russians more amenable to the need for international action so that this unprecedented form of power did not become a postwar threat to the world.<br> <br>In Moscow, however, things did not go much better. Molotov was as obstructionist as ever. He persisted in making flip remarks about America&#x2019;s atomic ace in the hole, clearly aimed at letting Byrnes know the Soviet Union would not be cowed into making political concessions. As in the Potsdam and London conferences, no member of the Soviet delegation showed any interest in discussing the bomb, or the proposed resolution for the creation of a United Nations commission to control atomic energy. The Soviets never demanded the sharing of the atomic &#x201c;secret,&#x201d; or objected to the need for an inspection system&#x2014;something that would not be popular in the United States, let alone in Russia&#x2014;to police all military and industrial plants to prevent abuses and safeguard against any nation clandestinely stockpiling weapons.<br> <br>Conant had felt it was imperative the Soviets should know about this radical new method of decisive warfare, and was surprised to find there were no technical questions, no arguments. Although his arrival in Moscow had been covered at length in the local press, not a single Soviet scientist had sought him out. Molotov, during the course of a dinner at which he was host, had suggested that perhaps the great American chemist, who was also president of a great American citadel of learning, should address the University of Moscow on the subject of atomic energy. The following day, however, Molotov withdrew the invitation, stating that he had no authority to make such an offer and was &#x201c;only trying to be pleasant.&#x201d; If Byrnes had been hoping the presence of the illustrious atomic pioneer at the negotiations would spark debate about the future of the bomb, his ploy fizzled. Conant felt like he might as well have stayed home for all the good he had done. He never suspected that the reason behind the Soviets&#x2019; apparent disregard was to prevent any chance of an inadvertent leak by Russian scientists that might alert the US delegation that they were feverishly at work on an atom bomb of their own.<br> <br>Conant had lost count of how many times they had drained their glasses when Molotov, who was acting as master of ceremonies, rose slowly to his feet. Raising a freshly filled glass, a broad grin on his round, bespectacled accountant&#x2019;s face, he proposed to the assembled party that they had all had enough to drink to allow them to &#x201c;speak of secret matters.&#x201d; Turning to Conant, he said mischievously, &#x201c;Here sits a man who perhaps is carrying a bit of the atomic bomb in his waist-coat pocket, with which he could blow us all to tiny pieces&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Before he could finish, Stalin jumped to his feet and broke in angrily, &#x201c;Comrade Molotov, this is too serious a matter to joke about.&#x201d; After the sharp rebuke of his unruly foreign minister, Stalin explained that although he was no scientist himself and had absolutely no knowledge of physics, he was not prepared to make light of Conant&#x2019;s work. He then addressed the issue of the bomb for the first time. He praised Conant and his fellow atomic scientists for their achievement in creating the weapon that had brought the war to a close. They had rendered &#x201c;a great service,&#x201d; he continued in his hoarse voice. &#x201c;We must now work together to see that this great invention is used for peaceful ends.&#x201d; On that solemn note, he raised his glass in honor of the quiet, silver-haired American chemist. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s to Professor Conant.&#x201d;<br> <br>Molotov, whose expression never altered, stood in grim silence. No one dared look in his direction. In the Politburo, survival depended on accurately reading and responding to the generalissimo&#x2019;s moods, and anyone who earned his displeasure could expect there to be consequences. After an awkward pause, Conant stood. Holding his glass aloft, he thanked Stalin for his kind statement, and gamely acknowledged Molotov&#x2019;s &#x201c;humorous remarks,&#x201d; though in truth he was rather floored by his cavalier attitude. Adding that he felt sufficiently emboldened by their sentiments, and by the &#x201c;molecular energy of the excellent wine,&#x201d; he offered a toast of his own, addressed to his Russian counterparts at the table. &#x201c;I have no atomic energy in my pocket,&#x201d; he began a bit sheepishly. &#x201c;But I can say that the scientists of Russia and those of the other countries represented here tonight worked together to win a common victory. I trust they may cooperate equally effectively in the tasks of peace which lie ahead.&#x201d;<br> <br>After the coffee was served, and Conant rose to leave, Stalin detained him for a moment. The Soviet leader was much shorter and broader in person than Conant had imagined: not more than five foot four inches tall, he resembled &#x201c;a shrewd but kindly and humble old peasant.&#x201d; Speaking through an interpreter, Stalin repeated his earlier congratulations and again expressed his hope that the bomb could be used only for peaceful purposes and not for war. Then, referring to Conant&#x2019;s generous toast, he added quietly, &#x201c;Those were fine words, but were they sincere?&#x201d;<br> <br>Later, a few of the Americans and British gathered at Spaso House, the grand neoclassical manor that served as the US embassy, to share their impressions of the astonishing moment when history appeared to have suddenly changed course. Stalin had publicly humiliated his longest-serving deputy at a state dinner, signaling a decisive&#x2014;if rather impulsive&#x2014;change in attitude. While the generalissimo could be capricious, he knew what he was doing. Whether his displeasure with Molotov was genuine or staged was hard to tell. But the significance of the moment was not lost on anyone.

He not only mastered the traditions, processes, and rules of the House of Representatives where he served for a half century, but also acquired a vast and detailed knowledge of naval matters (and later the armed services in general) and displayed consummate skill in drafting and managing legislation designed to modernize and strengthen the Navy in particular and the armed forces and national defense in general.Known as the &#34;Georgia Swamp Fox&#34; or &#34;the Admiral,&#34; Vinson was an astute and crafty tactician in the political arena with an incredibly acute sense of timing, who knew how to play pork barrel politics and knew when and how to compromise. For most of his tenure in Congress he was either the chairman or the ranking minority member of the Naval Affairs/Armed Services Committee. In time, he came to wield enormous power in shaping naval and military policies. In many respects, he was the principal architect of the nation&#39;s modern defense system. Organized chronologically and written in lean, graceful prose, this work is based upon deep and wide-ranging research in both primary and secondary sources. This study is all the more remarkable in view of the fact that Vinson did not write an autobiography, keep a diary, or preserve his personal papers. This cogent and readable biography of Carl Vinson is also the story of America and the South in a time of transition and change. Vinson once said, &#34;It takes genius to commit the story of a crusty old man like myself into something readable.&#34; James F. Cook has achieved this, and Vinson would be impressed.</p><p>James F.

In the SOE women were trained to handle guns and explosives, work undercover, endure interrogation by the Gestapo, and use complex codes. In <em>The Women Who Lived for Danger</em>, acclaimed historian Marcus Binney recounts the story of ten remarkable women who were dropped in occupied territories to work as secret agents.</p><p>Once they were behind enemy lines, theirs was the most dangerous war of all, as they led apparently normal civilian lives while in constant danger of arrest. They organized dropping grounds for arms and explosives destined for the Resistance, helped operate escape lines for airmen who had been shot down over Europe, and provided Allied Command with vital intelligence. SOE women agents came from all walks of life: from the dazzling Polish Countess Krystyna Skarbek (alias Christine Granville) and the American Virginia Hall, who was from a rich Baltimore family, to Marguerite Knight, a secretary in Walthamstow. Petite Lisa de Baissac lived next to Gestapo headquarters in Poitiers playing the part of a quiet widow, while twenty-year-old student Paola Del Din was sent to find a way through the German front line in Florence. Hot-tempered Paddy O'Sullivan deflected a German officer from examining her suitcase by making a date with him, and Alix d'Unienville feigned madness when captured.</p><p>The stories of these women agents -- some famous, some virtually unknown -- are told with the help of extensive new archive material. Their exploits form a new chapter of heroism in the history of warfare matched only by their determination, resourcefulness, and ability to stay cool in the face of extreme danger.</p></p><p><p>Marcus Binney is an accomplished historian and writer who is the author of <em>Our Vanishing Heritage</em>, <em>Townhouses</em>, and <em>Airports</em>. Binney attended Cambridge, and has lectured extensively to historical societies in New York, Boston, Rhode Island, and Virginia on architectural preservation and history. He has also fronted a thirty-nine-part series -- <em>Mansions: The Great Houses of Europe</em> -- broadcast in the U.S. between 1993 and 1997.</p><p>Binney's interest in the lives of the agents of the SOE is a personal one. His father, Lt. Col. Francis Simms, MC, walked seven hundred miles through the Apennines after twice escaping from POW camps. His mother, Sonia, did secret work with code breakers during the war and in 1955 remarried Sir George Binney, DSO, also a war hero, who had carried out one of the most successful blockade-running operations of World War II in 1941 -- bringing back five unarmed merchant ships from Sweden through the minefields.</p>In this collection of short, suspenseful biographies, Binney (Our Vanishing Heritage; Chateaux of the Loire, etc.) draws on published accounts, interviews and official records (including personnel files) to recount the careers of 10 women who spied for the British Special Operations Executive in German-occupied Europe. During World War II, these women operated as intelligence agents, clandestine radio operators and German saboteurs for the SOE-an organization created to wreak havoc behind German lines. Several were caught, tortured and later executed. Among them were Christina Granville, whom the press later dubbed "a modern pimpernel no man could resist," Virginia Hall, an American newspaper woman with a wooden leg who worked three years in occupied territory without being arrested, and Lela Karayanni, who organized sabotage with the help of her five children. Although much has already been written about some of the women in this history, a few of those featured are less well known, such Paola Del Din, who carried secret messages through the German front line in Florence. And Binney's use of official sources lends an air of authenticity often absent in some earlier accounts of these women's careers. (He also provides background on the SOE's history, training and operations for readers untutored in WWII special operations and espionage particulars.) Although the treatment of these heroines is a bit cursory and occasionally romanticized (e.g. "the girls who served as secret agents in Churchill's Special Operations Executive were young, beautiful, and brave"), Binney succeeds in presenting a lively, accurate introduction to 10 courageous women and their unusual exploits. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Devotions (Phoenix Poets)</h2><p><p>In the hands of Bruce Smith, devotions are momentary stops to listen to the motor of history. They are meditations and provocations. They are messages received from the chatter of the street and from transmissions as distant as Memphis and al-Mansur. Bulletins and interruptions come from brutal elsewheres and from the interior where music puts electrodes on the body to take an EKG. These poems visit high schools, laundromats, motels, films, and dreams in order to measure the American hunger and thirst. They are interested in the things we profess to hold most dear as well as what&#x2019;s unspoken and unbidden. While we&#x2019;re driving, while riding a bus, while receiving a call, while passing through an X-ray machine, the personal is intersected&#x2014;sometimes violently, sometimes tenderly&#x2014;with the hum and buzz of the culture. The culture, whether New York or Tuscaloosa, Seattle or Philadelphia, past or present, carries the burden of race and &#x201c;someone&#x2019;s idea of beauty.&#x201d; The poems fluctuate between the two poles of &#x201c;lullaby and homicide&#x201d; before taking a vow to remain on earth, to look right and left, to wait and to witness.</p></p><p><p><b>Bruce Smith</b> is professor of English and creative writing at Syracuse University and the author of four books of poems.

Mong knows it is the new minister who is guilty. But he bides his time, watching, listening, slowly circling his prey. Building to a climax that is almost too much to bear with the town&#39;s church ablaze, the Captain is compelled to pursue the murderer across the veldt,while his exhausted quarry struggles to make good his escape.

As with all matters in the hands of Dame Muriel her spooks are entirely original. A ghost in her pantheon can be plaintive or a bit vengeful, or perhaps may not even be aware of being a ghost at all. One in fact is the ghost of a man who isn't even dead yet. Another takes the bus home from work, believing she is still alive, though she is haunted by an odious tune stuck in her head (which her murderer had been relentlessly humming), and distressed by a "feeling of incompletion." And a reflective ghost recalls her mortal days of enjoying "the glory of the world, as if it would never pass. Spark has a flair for confiding ghosts: "I must explain that I departed this life nearly five years ago. But I did not altogether depart this world. There were those odd things still to be done which one's executors can never do properly." In her case the odd things include cheerily hailing her murderer, "Hallo George!" and driving him mad. The remarkably nonchalant stories here include some of her most wicked and famous"The Seraph and the Zambesi," "The Hanging Judge," and "The Portobello Road"and they all gleam with that special Spark sheen, the quality <em>The Times Literary Supplement</em> has hailed as "gloriously witty and polished."</p><p>Muriel Spark (1918&#x2013;2006) was the author of dozens of novels, including The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Memento Mori, A Far Cry from Kensington, The Girls of Slender Means, The Ballad of Peckham Rye, The Driver&#x2019;s Seat, and many more. She became Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.&#34;Spark remains in total control at all times: She can summon a world with a single gesture, a character with one seemingly artless remark. Profound art disguised as a lark.&#34;</p><h2>The Stories Julian Tells</h2><p>Julian is a little boy with a big imagination.

Observing the effects of religious fundamentalism, it argues that the problem lies in all religions, because each of them believes that theirs is the one true god, and that all others must therefore be false.

Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p>Ken Kesey (1935-2001) was raised in Oregon, graduated from the University of Oregon, and later studied at Stanford University. He was the author of four novels, two children&#39;s books, and several works of nonfiction.</p><h2>Doodling with Jim Henson: More than 50 fun &amp; fanciful artistic exercises to inspire the doodler in you!</h2><p><p>Jim Henson, an extraordinary artist and visionary, invented unique worlds and characters that remain just as vivid, original and fresh today as when they were created.

This book adds to the repertoire of possibilities by providing instructions for five comfortably soft jackets.<br><br>The author, Nancie M. Wiseman, has used a variety of techniques to try to give each jacket some style that is described as sophisticated and chic . The projects feature asymmetrical openings, unique collars and closures and beautiful accent fabrics.<br><br>I'm not sure that I'd go so far as to describe the ends results as sophisticated and chic , but there s no denying that these jackets would be fun to make and wear, be much faster and easier than starting from scratch with a jacket pattern in a packet, and be warm without being terribly bulky. And, of course, they're quite a way removed from merely appliquéing or machine embroidering on a sweatshirt. <br><br>The instructions seem quite detailed and Wiseman assures her readers than none of the jackets is hard to make. So, if you're looking for a fun and useful project for the winter and an excuse to use (and wear!) one of your precious, most gorgeous cotton fabrics, this book would be a good starting point.

I have said this myself many times. I have made many sweatshirt jackets embellished with crochet, knitting, patchwork, quilting and embroidery but wish I had seen this book first. Alas! When the bug first bit me, there were no published how-to books and so I fudged, punted, adjusted, and of course, made many errors using the trial and error method. Still, I love and wear my sweatshirt jackets.<br><br>Readers of this book can be spared trial and error methods. Well-known and respected crafter, designer, knitter and crocheter, Nancie Weisman makes it much easier than that! Her new book, <i>Start with a Sweatshirt: Sew a Stylish Jacket</i> leaves nothing to chance. <br><br>First things first. "Deconstructing the Sweatshirt" begins the process with clear instructions and diagrams. This means removing the existing bands at sleeve and bottom leaving only that nice, warm, soft fleecy feeling so characteristic of sweatshirts. <br>Second, the author explains how to interface and prepare the shirt for embellishment. Following these basic processes, she offers five exquisite jackets. The Mandarin style shown on the cover speaks for itself in subtle beauty and an asymmetrical closure, so traditional with Asian garments.<br> <br>Speaking of asymmetrical, the jacket featuring fabric tucks arranged vertically, horizontally and diagonally is a thing of beauty. I have never seen an outerwear garment quite like it. To finish her book, the author illustrates her tricks of the trade in perfect, well designed "finishing" for the garment itself. I do believe I need another sweatshirt jacket myself and have the perfect sweatshirt in waiting. --Sylvia Landman, Sylvia's Studio</p><h2>A Dog&#39;s Life</h2><p>Celebrate the life of your pet by collecting photos of your dog and his companions and documenting your favoritestories in this personal record book.</p><p></p><h2>Shadowrun: Matrix (FAS7909) (Shadowrun 7909)</h2><p>Reality is for those who lack imagination Connect to the world-wide net known as the Matrix and create a universe of your own.

But I hope I&#x2019;ll be able to get enough.</i><br>&nbsp;<br><b><br>DAY ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br><b><br>TWO</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Patricia Henderson, forty-one, divorced, employed at the Weston Street Branch of the Promise Falls Public Library System as a computer librarian, was, on that Saturday morning of the long holiday weekend in May, among the first to die.&nbsp;<br><br>She was scheduled to work that day. Patricia was annoyed the library board chose to keep all of the town&#x2019;s libraries open. They were slated to close on the Sunday, and on the Monday, Memorial Day. So, if you&#x2019;re going to close Sunday and Monday, why not close for the Saturday, too, and give everyone at the library the weekend off?&nbsp;<br><br>But no.&nbsp;<br><br>Not that Patricia had anywhere in particular to go.&nbsp;<br><br>But still. It seemed ridiculous to her. She knew, given that it was a long weekend, there&#x2019;d be very few people coming into the library. Wasn&#x2019;t this town supposed to be in the midst of a financial crisis? Why keep the place open? Sure, there was a bit of a rush on Friday as some customers, particularly those who had cottages or other weekend places, took out books to keep them occupied through to Tuesday. The rest of the weekend was guaranteed to be quiet.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia was to be at the library for nine, when it opened, but that really meant she needed to be there for eight forty-five a.m. That would give her time to boot up all the computers, which were shut down every night at closing to save on electricity, even though the amount of power the branch&#x2019;s thirty computers drew overnight was negligible. The library board, however, was on a &#x201c;green&#x201d; kick, which meant not only conserving electricity, but making sure recycling stations were set up throughout the library, and signs pinned to the bulletin boards to discourage the use of bottled water. One of the library board members saw the bottled water industry, and the bins of plastic bottles it created, as one of the great evils of the modern world, and didn&#x2019;t want them in any of the Promise Falls branches. &#x201c;Provide paper cups that can be filled at the facility&#x2019;s water fountains,&#x201d; she said. Which now meant that the recycling stations were overflowing with paper cups instead of water bottles.&nbsp;<br><br>And guess who was pissed about that. What&#x2019;s-his-name, that Finley guy who used to be mayor and now ran a water bottling company. Patricia had met him the first&#x2013;and she hoped,&nbsp;<i>last&nbsp;</i>&#x2013;time just the other evening at the Constellation Drive-in. She&#x2019;d taken her niece Kaylie and her little friend Alicia for the drive-in&#x2019;s final night. Kaylie&#x2019;s mom &#x2013; Patricia&#x2019;s sister Val &#x2013; had lent her their minivan, since Patricia&#x2019;s Hyundai was a little too cramped for such an excursion. God, what a mistake that turned out to be. Not only did the screen come crashing down, scaring the little girls half to death, but then Finley showed up, trying to get his picture taken giving comfort to the wounded.&nbsp;<br><i><br>Politics</i>, Patricia thought. How she hated politics and everything about it.&nbsp;<br><br>And thinking of politics, Patricia had found herself staring at the ceiling at four in the morning, worried about next week&#x2019;s public meeting on &#x201c;Internet filtering.&#x201d; The debate had been going on for years and never seemed settled. Should the library put filters on computers used by patrons that would restrict access to certain websites? The idea was to keep youngsters from accessing pornography, but it was a continuing quagmire. The filters were often ineffective, blocking material that was not adult oriented, and allowing material that was. And aside from that, there were freedom of speech and freedom to read issues.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia knew the meeting would, as these kinds of meetings always did, devolve into a shouting match between ultraconservatives who saw gay subtext in the&nbsp;<i>Teletubbies</i>&nbsp;and didn&#x2019;t want computers in the library to begin with, and ultra left-wingers who believed if a kindergartner wanted to read&nbsp;<i>Portnoy&#x2019;s Complaint</i>, so be it.&nbsp;<br><br>At ten minutes after five, when she knew she wasn&#x2019;t going to get back to sleep, she threw back the covers and decided to move forward with her day.&nbsp;<br><br>She walked into the bathroom, flicked on the light, and studied her face in the mirror.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ick,&#x201d; she said, rubbing her cheeks with the tips of her fingers. &#x201c;ABH.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>That was the mantra from Charlene, her personal trainer.

Which meant drinking at least seven full glasses of water a day.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia reached for the glass next to the sink, turned on the tap to let the water run until it was cold, filled the glass and drank it down in one long gulp. She reached into the shower, turned on the taps, held her hand under the spray until it was hot enough, pulled the long, white T-shirt she slept in over her head, and stepped in.&nbsp;<br><br>She stayed in there until she could sense the hot water starting to run out.

Or, if she decided to ride her bike, about twenty-five minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia opened the cupboard, took out a small metal tray with more than a dozen bottles of pills and multivitamins. She opened the lids on four, tapped out a calcium tablet, a low-dose aspirin, a vitamin D, and a multivitamin, which, while containing vitamin D, did not, she believed, have enough.&nbsp;<br><br>She tossed them all into her mouth at once and washed them down with a small glass of water from the kitchen tap. Moved her upper body all around awkwardly, as though her blouse were made of wool.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia opened the refrigerator and stared. Did she want an egg? Hard-boiled? Fried?

The letters in &#x201c;Special&#x201d; were a good inch tall.&nbsp;<br><br>Patricia squinted.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Special,&#x201d; she said.&nbsp;<br><br>She closed her eyes, shook her head, thinking that would set things straight.

She&#x2019;d gotten drunk more than a few times over the years with her ex, Stanley. But even then, she&#x2019;d never had enough to drink that the room spun. She had to go back to her days as a student at Thackeray for a memory like that.&nbsp;<br><br>But Patricia hadn&#x2019;t been drinking. And what she was feeling now wasn&#x2019;t the same as what she&#x2019;d felt back then.&nbsp;<br><br>For one thing, her heart was starting to race.&nbsp;<br><br>She placed a hand on her chest, just about the swell of her breasts, to see if she could feel what she already knew she was feeling.&nbsp;<br><i><br>Tha-thump.

The book explains why such a highly criticized system persists. Katz explores the relationship between welfare and municipal reform; the role of welfare capitalism, eugenics, and social insurance in the reorganization of the labor market; the critical connection between poverty and politics in the rise of the New Deal welfare state; and how the War on Poverty of the � 60s became the war on welfare of the � 80s.</p><p>This controversial history of welfare in America argues that government must be the source of social progress.In this history, Katz explores the roots of our ambivalence toward welfare and the welfare state, revealing the patterns which have recurred from era to era and which continue to frustrate reformers to this day. From the poorhouse era to the New Deal, from the War on Poverty to the War on Welfare, Katz provides the long perspective so often missing from the debates over &#34;ending welfare as we know it&#34;. And this tenth anniversary edition contains an expanded introduction and a new concluding chapter, bringing the story to the present and analyzing the politics that lie behind the welfare reform act of 1996.</p><h2>13 Little Blue Envelopes</h2><p><p>Inside little blue envelope 1 are $1,000 and instructions to buy a plane ticket. </p><p> In envelope 2 are directions to a specific London flat. </p><p> The note in envelope 3 tells Ginny: Find a starving artist. </p><p> Because of envelope 4, Ginny and a playwright/thief/ bloke&#x2013;about&#x2013;town called Keith go to Scotland together, with somewhat disastrous&#x2013;though utterly romantic&#x2013;results.

She lives in New York City, but travels to the UK regularly to soak up the drizzle and watch English TV.</p>Grade 8-10&#x2013;This whirlwind adventure begins as Ginny, 17, reads a letter from her free-spirited, unpredictable Aunt Peg, who has recently passed away. She is given several destinations, four rules, and the instruction to open one envelope upon her arrival at each place. Thus begins a rapid tour of Europe as the teen struggles to accomplish the tasks established by her aunt. The motivation: Ginny wants to understand the woman's wanderlust and, possibly, she just wants a connection to her beloved relative. Throughout her adventures in Rome, Paris, Greece, England, and the Netherlands, the teen collects pieces of Peg's past and learns more about her rapid departure. She also learns much about herself. The reason Ginny is sent to meet certain people is not always clear; sometimes she (and readers) wonder about the point of the exercise. Overall, though, the novel drives home the importance of family, love, and the value of connections that you make with people.

They didn&#x2019;t look all that great: they were worn, dirty, and speckled with bleach. On the night before she and her friends part for the summer, Carmen decides to toss them. But Tibby says they&#x2019;re great. She'd love to have them. Lena and Bridget also think they&#x2019;re fabulous. Lena decides that they should all try them on. Whoever they fit best will get them. Nobody knows why, but the pants fit everyone perfectly. Even Carmen (who never thinks she looks good in anything) thinks she looks good in the pants. Over a few bags of cheese puffs, they decide to form a sisterhood and take the vow of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . . . the next morning, they say good-bye. And then the journey of the pants &#x2014; and the most memorable summer of their lives &#x2014; begins.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>They were just a soft, ordinary pair of thrift-shop jeans until the four girls took turns trying them on--four girls, that is, who are close friends, about to be parted for the summer, with very different sizes and builds, not to mention backgrounds and personalities. Yet the pants settle on each girl's hips perfectly, making her look sexy and long-legged and feel confident as a teenager can feel. "These are magical Pants!" they realize, and so they make a pact to share them equally, to mail them back and forth over the summer from wherever they are. Beautiful, distant Lena is going to Greece to be with her grandparents; strong, athletic Bridget is off to soccer camp in Baja, California; hot-tempered Carmen plans to have her divorced father all to herself in South Carolina; and Tibby the rebel will be left at home to slave for minimum wage at Wallman's.<p> Over the summer the Pants come to represent the support of the sisterhood, but they also lead each girl into bruising and ultimately healing confrontations with love and courage, dying and forgiveness. Lena finds her identity in Greece and the courage not to reject love; Bridget gets in over her head with an older camp coach; Carmen finds her father ensconced with a new fianc�e and family; and Tibby unwillingly takes on a filmmaking apprentice who is dying of leukemia. Each girl's story is distinct and engrossing, told in a brightly contemporary style. Like the Pants, the reader bounces back and forth among the four unfolding adventures, and the melange is spiced with letters and witty quotes.

In Mapping the Farm, John Hildebrand, whom the New Yorker magazine praised for his "skill of mind and craft," focuses on the O'Neills, the family of his wife Sharon, and their 240 acres near Rochester, Minnesota.<br><br>When William O'Neill began raising dairy cows in Minnesota in 1880, America was a nation of farmers.

In this book, Jeff Walker debunks the cult-like following that developed around the author of the classics Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead--a cult that persists even today.</p><p>Jeff Walker has worked as a journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and written for many periodicals, including the GLOBE AND MAIL, the TORONTO STAR, FREE INQUIRY, LIBERTY, and the FINANCIAL TIMES OF CANADA. He lives in Toronto.Much adored and much reviled, Ayn Rand finds no sympathy at the hands of Canadian investigative journalist Walker. Like many others, he compares the Objectivist guru and Atlas Shrugged author to a cult leader, while attacking her claims of originality, consistency, literary talent, and morality. Rand's novels made free-marketeers out of almost as many 1950s and '60s teens as Kerouac's On the Road made restless beatniks. At least two generations have been influenced by her loyalty to a peculiarly stark form of individualism, the reification of rationality, and moral approbation of selfish profit-seeking. In the midst of the Cold War, Randian thinking struck a chord, and she, the former Russian Jew Alissa Rosenbaum, attracted a sizeable circle of devoted followers. Too devoted, says Walker, claiming that this philosophical success story tells less than half the tale. He argues that Objectivism garnered intelligent yet sadly impressionable youths, intimidating them into total emotional submission. Interviews with prominent former Objectivists reveal Rand's repulsively didactic character, her intolerance for criticism or disagreement of any kind, and her vindictiveness when spurned by a disciple. Walker does not stop at characterizing Rand as a cultist. He seeks to discredit her altogether by showing that, despite her brainwashed followers' claims that Rand was the greatest thinker since Aristotle, everything she wrote was either derivative (from a combination of Jewish tradition, laissez-faire manifestos, and mystery novels), devoid of literary value (he performs a painful count of monstrously overused words in Atlas), or both. That Ayn Rand was inflated beyond her merit will shock nobody but Objectivists, who will never read this book. Walker's expos is a bit too shrill, repetitive, and even snide to rise persuasively above the people he describesbut he does convey vividly the frightful mess that was Ayn Rand. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Nothing, of course, unless such outward bodily concerns are <i>perceived</i> to hold some sort of spiritual significance. Such was the case in the multireligious world of medieval Spain, where the ways in which one dressed, washed, and fed the body were seen as potential indicators of religious affiliation. True faith might be a matter of the soul, but faith <i>identity</i> could also literally be worn on the sleeve or reinforced through performance of the most intimate functions of daily life.</p><p>The significance of these practices changed over time in the eyes of Christian warriors, priests, and common citizens who came to dominate all corners of the Iberian peninsula by the end of the fifteenth century. Certain "Moorish" fashions occasionally crossed over religious lines, while visits to a local bathhouse and indulgence in a wide range of exotic foods were frequently enjoyed by Muslims, Christians, and Jews alike. Yet at the end of the Middle Ages, attitudes hardened. With the fall of Granada, and the eventual forced baptism of all Spain's remaining Muslims, any perceived retention of traditional "Moorish" lifestyles might take on a sinister overtone of disloyalty and resistance. Distinctive clothing choices, hygienic practices, and culinary tastes could now lead to charges of secret allegiance to Islam. Repressive legislation, inquisitions, and ultimately mass deportations followed.</p><p><i>To Live Like a Moor</i> traces the many shifts in Christian perceptions of Islam-associated ways of life which took place across the centuries between early <i>Reconquista</i> efforts of the eleventh century and the final expulsions of Spain's converted yet poorly assimilated <i>Morisco</i> population in the seventeenth. Using a wealth of social, legal, literary, and religious documentation in this, her last book, Olivia Remie Constable revealed the complexities and contradictions underlying a historically notorious transition from pluralism to intolerance.</p></p><p>Olivia Remie Constable (1960-2014) was the Robert M. Conway Director of the Medieval Institute and Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame. She was author of Trade and Traders in Muslim Spain: The Commercial Realignment of the Iberian Peninsula 900-1500 and Housing the Stranger in the Mediterranean World: Lodging, Trade, and Travel in Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Medieval Iberia: Readings from Christian, Muslim, and Jewish Sources, her monumental collection of primary source material, is also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press. Robin Vose is Professor of History at St. Thomas University, New Brunswick, Canada. David Nirenberg is the Deborah R. and Edgar D. Jannotta Distinguished Service Professor of Social Thought, Medieval History, Romance Languages and Literatures, and the College at the University of Chicago.<p>Editor's Preface</p><p>"Perceptions" of Islam, and their development over time, form the topic of this book. But where others have explored such perceptions above all as they were expressed in a select corpus of contemporary theological, legal, or literary texts, Olivia Remie Constable's approach here was rather that of a wide-ranging social historian. The author's ability to glean evidence from a dizzying array of archival documents, manuscript and printed volumes, architectural remains, and material objects permitted her to weave together precisely the sort of nuanced and colorful tapestry that best represents the complexities of lived&#x2014;as opposed to idealized&#x2014;experience. "A long process of hunting and gathering," she once called her method; or "trying to piece together a jigsaw puzzle of unknown design, in which many of the pieces are missing and some of the available pieces are borrowed from other apparently similar puzzles." From legal and economic documents to chronicles (both royal and more localized) and cookbooks, religious treatises, travelers' accounts, poetry, artistic representations&#x2014;Olivia Remie Constable was able to draw on all these and more to work out a more comprehensive and nuanced sense of just how medieval and early modern Iberian Christians' perceptions of their Muslim neighbors actually manifested and changed over the course of more than five centuries.</p><p>The tensions evident between any one source's depiction and the composite images resulting from a more expansive and inclusive approach are reflected in Constable's conscious decision to frame her analysis (at least initially) around the testimony of a single Morisco elder: Francisco N��ez Muley. Taking her lead from his passionate denunciation of the Christian regime's criminalization of heretofore licit practices widespread among the formerly Muslim population of Granada, she identified three major categories of behavior that were deemed to be unacceptable markers of "Islamic" identity by the middle of the sixteenth century: the adoption of certain types of clothing and appearance, certain approaches to bathing and hygiene, and use of traditional Arabic forms of communication (including naming and musical performance as well as speech and text). Yet a fourth category, left unmentioned by N��ez Muley in this text, also emerges in many other sources as an equally important area of dispute and a marker of difference: certain types of food preparation and consumption. This latter category had to be given due consideration, even if it did not always strike one relatively acculturated and privileged male witness as being worthy of comment, if a full picture of past experience was to be effectively rendered.</p><p>Constable's great original insight and research contribution with this book was to document how day-to-day cultural habits&#x2014;especially habits that were <i>bodily</i> in nature, and in particular those that could be specifically linked to <i>female</i> bodies&#x2014;became a primary focal point of anti-Muslim sentiment from the later Middle Ages to the beginning of the early modern period. Quite apart from their concerns over Islamic theological beliefs, Spanish Christians became increasingly antipathetic to the ways in which Spanish Muslims (and many of their converted Morisco descendants) dressed, bathed, spoke, and ate. These seemingly innocuous daily practices served as lightning rods for struggles over distinctiveness, assimilation, and the limits of toleration in the Iberian Peninsula. It was both by listening closely to what Francisco N��ez Muley had to say and by going beyond his singular perspective to see how other aspects of the same problem actually emerged over a long period of time that Remie Constable was able to bring together and make coherent such a vast mass of otherwise discordant information on such a very important topic. The result is a careful presentation of how and (where possible) why attitudes fitfully evolved to arrive at the tragic experiences of N��ez Muley's generation and the subsequent final expulsion of their children and grandchildren from Iberian soil.</p><p>***</p><p>The decision to seek publication of a work that, while near completion in many ways, remained unfinished at the time of its author's illness and death, was not taken lightly. There was, in particular, a problem with one of the four analytic sections originally intended for study. Constable had completed much of her research on the topic of language, naming practices, and songs, however the draft chapter laying out this information existed only in an incomplete outline. After much discussion, first with Remie herself and later with several of her closest confidants, it was reluctantly decided that only the three most complete of the four sections, those on dress, bathing, and food, should be submitted for publication as a coherent piece of scholarship that could stand proudly on its own merits. This meant leaving out a key planned chapter on evolving Spanish Christian perceptions of the Arabic language, and related linguistic and musical performances, as markers of religious identity. The importance of these topics to the original project remains evident in Professor Constable's introductory chapter, and there seemed no reason to hide it or to gloss over the resulting gap.</p><p>The virtue of this approach has been to retain, as much as possible, Remie Constable's own voice. The editor's role has been deliberately minimal. For the most part, it was limited to careful checking and rechecking of references, polishing and standardization of format, and completion of occasional unfinished thoughts (usually following meticulously recorded prompts from the author's own notes). Brief conclusions were imposed on each chapter for the sake of closure&#x2014;Constable had deliberately left them open-ended because she was always adding more data, and consequently adjusting her ideas, to the very end. The only substantial research contribution by the editor appears in subsections relating to the use of henna (in Chapter 2), the impact of syphilis on questions of bathing hygiene (in Chapter 3), and the use of implements such as forks (in Chapter 4); further bibliographical information on modern debates over Islamic veiling was also added to Chapter 1. All these additions were scripted by Olivia Remie Constable's notes, with generous hints and clues to be followed, but any errors or distortions inadvertently introduced therein should not be held to her account.</p></p><h2>Lanterns on the Levee: Recollections of a Planter&#39;s Son (Library of Southern Civilization)</h2><p>Born and raised in Greenville, Mississippi, within the shelter of old traditions, aristocratic in the best sense, William Alexander Percy in his lifetime (1885&#x2013;1942) was brought face to face with the convulsions of a changing world. Lanterns on the Levee is his memorial to the South of his youth and young manhood. In describing life in the Mississippi Delta, Percy bridges the interval between the semifeudal South of the 1800s and the anxious South of the early 1940s. The rare qualities of this classic memoir lie not in what Will Percy did in his life&#x2014;although his life was exciting and varied&#x2014;but rather in the intimate, honest, and soul-probing record of how he brought himself to contemplate unflinchingly a new and unstable era. The 1973 introduction by Walker Percy&#x2014;Will's nephew and adopted son&#x2014;recalls the strong character and easy grace of "the most extraordinary man I have ever known." AUTHOR BIO: William Alexander Percy was the author of four books of poetry, and he practiced law in Greenville until his death, one year after the publication of his autobiography.

She is lucky. But she is also restless. In <i>Uplake</i> she takes road trips, flies to distant cities, fantasizes about other people's lives, and then returns home again to muse on rootedness, yearning, commitment, ambition, wonder, and love. These engaging, reflective essays celebrate the richness of it all: winter floods and summer fires, the roar of a chainsaw and a fiddle in the wilderness, long hikes and open-water swims, an injured bear, a lost wedding ring, and a tree in the middle of a river. <i>Uplake</i> reminds us to love what we have while encouraging us to still imagine what we want.</p><p><b>Ana Maria Spagna</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Reclaimers</i> and <i>Potluck: Community on the Edge of Wilderness</i>.

In 2010, the gruesome corpse of a nun is found in a Dublin public park.

Powderburns is the story of Celerino Castillo III who spent 12 years in the Drug Enforcement Administration. During that time, he built cases against organized drug rings in Manhattan, raided jungle cocaine labs in the Amazon, conducted aerial eradication operations in Guatemala, and assembled and trained anti-narcotics units in several countries. The eerie climax of Agent Castillo&#39;s career with the DEA took place in El Salvador. One day, he recieved a cable from a fellow agent. He was told to investigate possible drug smuggling by Nicaraguan Contras operating from the ilpango air force base. Castillo quickly discovered that Contra pilots were, indeed, smuggling narcotics back into the United States - using the same pilots, planes, and hangars that the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council, under the Direction of Lt. Col. Oliver North, used to maintain their covert supply operation to the Contras.</p><p></p><h2>Paying the Price: Ignacio Ellacur�a and the Murdered Jesuits of El Salvador</h2><p><p> On November 16, 1989, on the campus of El Salvador's University of Central America, six Jesuits and two women were murdered by members of the Salvadoran army, an army funded and trained by the United States. One of the murdered Jesuits was Ignacio Ellacur�a, the university's Rector and a key, although controversial, figure in Salvadoran public life. From an opening account of this terrible crime, <i>Paying the Price</i> asks, Why were they killed and what have their deaths meant? Answers come through Teresa Whitfield's detailed examination of Ellacur�a's life and work. His story is told in juxtaposition with the crucial role played by the unraveling investigation of the Jesuits' murders within El Salvador's peace process.</p><p> A complex and nuanced book, <i>Paying the Price</i> offers a history of the Church in El Salvador in recent decades, an analysis of Ellacur�a's philosophy and theology, an introduction to liberation theology, and an account of the critical importance of the University of Central America. In the end, Whitfield's comprehensive picture of conditions in El Salvador suggest that the Jesuits' murders were almost inevitable. A crime that proved a turning point in El Salvador's civil war, the murders expressed the deep tragedy of the Salvadoran people beyond suffering the heartless cruelty, violence, and deceitfulness of a corrupt military and their patrons in the U.S. government.</p><p> Whitfield draws on her extensive research of Jesuit archives and private papers, Ellacur�a's diaries, documents declassified by the U.S. government, and 200 interviews conducted with sources ranging from Jesuits to Salvadoran military officers, U.S. officials and congressmen to human rights campaigners.</p></p><p>An investigation of one of the morst tragic and divisive events in Latin American history"This is a brilliant and authoritative telling of one of our time's compelling dramas, the interplay of religion and politics in El Salvador over the last decades-sophisticated, complex and an absolute page-turner." <br>&#x2014;Tom Quigley, United Stated Catholic Conference <p>"More than an account of the most horrifying events in the litany of human rights violations in the history of El Salvador, this book is an acute analysis of the political and military context in which it happened. Few books about El Salvador have dug as deep into the entrails of the Salvadoran reality, nor reflected as much access to major actors on all sides. Whitfield does not accept facile explanations, nor present the Jesuits as unidimensional. What she does do is demonstrate the impact of a few individuals who spoke out for justice in the face of massive inequalities and repeated threats. Ultimately their deaths contributed to an end to war in El Salvador and reinvigorated the struggle for basic human rights they held so dear." <br>&#x2014;Margaret E. Crahan, Henry R. Luce Professor of Religion, Power and the Political Process, Occidental College </p><p>"This eloquent, masterful book evokes the causes and consequences of the heartless murders of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador. I know of no other work which so richly or perceptively combines recent political history, theology, and biography to explain who the Jesuits were and why the armed forces set out coolly to eliminate them. The portrait of U.S. policy as it sought to protect the military is as riveting as it is disturbing." <br>&#x2014;Cynthia J. Arnson, Associate Director, Human Rights Watch/Americas</p></p><h2>Collectible Playing Cards (Collectibles)</h2><p>There are very few families who don't own at least one deck of cards. The hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds are a familiar sight to all of us. In fact, the use of playing cards has a rich history that dates back to the late 1300s. This volume features cards from all over the world; from the familiar format used for playing poker and bridge, to cards used by fortune tellers, to unique round packs from India. Showcasing over 400 different designs, <i>Collectible Playing Cards</i> takes the reader on a fascinating journey through history that spans the globe.<br></p><p><b>Fr�d�rique Crestin-Billet</b> is the editor of the Flammarion Collectibles series and also wrote <i>Collectible Corkscrews</i>.<br></p><h2>N Is for Noose (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)</h2><p>Female detective Kinsey Millhone becomes involved in the case of a double murder in Carson City and a detective who dies trying to investigate it</p><p>"Suppose we could peer through a tiny peephole in time and chance upon a flash of what was coming up in the years ahead?" The questioner is Kinsey Millhone, middle-aged, two-time divorcee detective and junk food junkie star of Sue Grafton's popular "alphabet" mysteries; the book is <i>'N' Is for Noose</i>. If Kinsey had had just a smidgen of foresight, she would never have taken her current case, handed down to her from her on-again, off-again flame and comrade in arms, Robert Dietz. We encounter the two this time out after Deitz's knee surgery, as Kinsey drives his "snazzy little red Porsche" back to Carson City, where she checks out his digs for the first time. To her surprise, he lives in a palatial penthouse, which--under the unspoken bylaws of investigative etiquette--she qualmlessly snoops through. They sit around for a fortnight playing gin rummy and eating peanut butter and pickle sandwiches together, but perennially single Kinsey grows wary: "It was time to hit the road before our togetherness began to chafe." <p> She heads off to meet Dietz's former client, Mrs. Selma Newquist, a devastated widow whose makeup tips seem to come from Tammy Faye Baker. Her husband Tom Newquist, a detective himself, had been working on a mysterious case when he abruptly died of a heart attack. Selma suspects foul play, but bless her, she isn't the brightest star in the sky and can't figure out what Tom was working on even though he's left behind enough paper to fill a recycling truck. Kinsey digs right in and roams the sleepy, one-horse town of Nota Lake for clues, interviewing a colorful cast of in-laws and locals. Beneath the quaint, quiet, country veneer, she unearths a bubbling hotbed of internal strife and familial double-dealing. Was Tom covering up for his partner? Is Selma protecting someone? Grafton's knack for gritty details and realistic characters ("[Selma's] skin tones suggested dark coloring, but her hair was a confection of white-blond curls, like a cloud of cotton candy"), coupled with the fast-paced, believable story line, makes for another delightful, entertaining read. --Rebekah Warren, Bestsellers editor</p>"Book for book, this may be the most satisfying mystery series going."<br>--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><p>"There are few writers able to sustain the solid mixture of detection, narrative energy and cultural observations that one finds so often in Grafton." <br>--<i>Washington Post Book World</i><br></p></p><h2>The North Channel and St. Mary&#39;s River: A guide to the History</h2><p>For centuries, Lake Huron's North Channel and St. Mary's River have provided an essential passageway, first for native peoples and then for successive waves of Europeans.

Each story is complete and updated for today&#39;s reader.</p><p>Grace Livingston Hill was born on April 16, 1865 to a Presbyterian Minister, Charles and a published author, Marcia, in Wellsville, New York. For her twelfth birthday, Hills Aunt Pansy had one of her stories published in a book of short stories. This was the beginning of Hills career as a writer. In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction. Grace Livingston Hill died in 1947 at the age of 82.</p><h2>The Soul (Mediaeval Philosophical Texts in Translation)</h2><p>William of Auvergne</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Palestine and Egypt Under the Ottomans: Paintings, Books, Photographs, Maps and Manuscripts</h2><p><i>Palestine and Egypt under the Ottomans</i> is based on a unique collection of art and printed material covering the 400 year period of Ottoman rule in the region.

She subsequently became a mother of two, a childbirth educator, grief counselor, and lecturer.Getting to Know Your Baby&#x2014;Completing Bonding We sensed our doctor was reluctant to show us our baby. But we were sure we wanted to see our son. This was very important to us. <p>Some mothers may be afraid they won&#x2019;t be able to cope with such an encounter. </p><p>Right after the birth my physician asked whether I wanted to see our stillborn daughter. I thought, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go crazy if I see her now.&#x201d; One or two hours later, after she had already been sent to the pathology department, I wanted to see her so much, but I just didn&#x2019;t have the courage to ask. </p><p>In the many encounters I have had with bereaved parents, I have never met anyone who, in retrospect, wished they hadn&#x2019;t seen their dead child. But almost all parents who did not see their baby still expressed regrets or were resentful of their caregivers years later for having deprived them of the opportunity. A restlessness lingered on that stemmed from unfinished business&#x2014;something that could never really be &#x201c;solved.&#x201d; </p><p>We need concrete memories of our child&#x2014;what she looked like, what was special about her, what effect she had on us. To have touched and held her in our arms&#x2014;or in our hands if she is very small&#x2014;and maybe even bathed and dressed her will create impressions that will remain in our hearts forever. Our baby will thus be able to take her place in our lives and in our family. Despite her death, this way no &#x201c;dark spot&#x201d; will remain to churn around deep inside, seeking to be brought to light. </p><p>You&#x2019;ll need time to really be able to register your child&#x2019;s uniqueness. It is healing for you to talk with him, to tell him everything that you feel from deep in your heart. You will need intimate time together. Maybe the hours or even just minutes after the death will be enough for you. Maybe later you will want to have him brought back to you so you can spend more time with him. It will be your only time together and only you can decide when enough is enough. To have been able to experience your child, to whatever extent possible, will bring you peace. </p><p>Nobody would think of asking a mother if she wanted to see her live baby. It is the most natural thing in the world for a mother to see her child&#x2014;dead or alive.

Fundamental problems, as Einstein once noted, cannot be solved at the same level of thought that created them. What we pay attention to, and how we pay attention - both individually and collectively - is key to what we create. What often prevents us from attending is what Scharmer calls our blind spot, the inner place from which each of us operates. Learning to become aware of our blind spot is critical to bringing forth the profound systemic changes so needed in business and society today. First introduced in Presence, the U methodology of leading profound change is expanded and deepened in Theory U. By moving through the &#34;U&#34; process we learn to connect to our essential Self in the realm of presencing - a term coined by Scharmer that combines the present with sensing. Here we are able to see our own blind spot and pay attention in a way that allows us to experience the opening of our minds, our hearts, and our wills. This wholistic opening constitutes a shift in awareness that allows us to learn from the future as it emerges, and to realize that future in the world. Theory U explores a new territory of scientific research and personal leadership, one that is grounded in real life experience and shared practices. Scharmer shares much from his own personal and professional development, and draws from a rich diversity of compelling stories and examples. Readers will find themselves drawn to new ways of thinking and acting as they read, completing a parallel journey of exploration and discovery. The final chapters lay out principles and practices that allow everyone to participate fully in co-creating and bringing forth the desired future that is working to emerge through us.</p><p>Praise for <i>Theory U</i> <p>"Scharmer's <i>Theory U</i> model of how to open our mind, emotions, and will to moments of discovery and mutual understanding is profound and much needed."<br> --Edgar Schein, Sloan Fellows Professor of Management Emeritus, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of <i>Helping</i> "Pushes the envelope of current leadership wisdom and invites you to explore the strongest leadership tool there is: yourself."<br> --Ralf Schneider, Head of Global Talent Management, PricewaterhouseCoopers "The impact of the <i>Theory U</i> method on our organization is remarkable, but even more important is the amazing personal growth many leaders have experienced. Scharmer's work has allowed them to experience a new approach to the world."<br> --Marcia Marsh, Chief Operating Officer, World Wildlife Fund "Though many agree with Einstein's observation that `problems cannot be resolved at the level of consciousness that created them' the key question remains how to realize such a shift. <i>Theory U</i> offers a unique integral perspective combined with a practical approach to addressing the megaissues facing our world today."<br> --Jack Jacometti, Vice President, Global GTL Development, Shell International Gas Limited "This book is an inspiration. It gives definition to the mystery of the creative process."<br> --Eileen Fisher, President and Chief Creative Officer, Eileen Fisher Inc.</p><b>Access the deepest source of inspiration and vision</b> <p>We live in a time of massive institutional failure, one that requires a new consciousness and a new collective leadership capacity. In this groundbreaking book, Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways and in so doing discover a revolutionary approach to leadership. </p><p>What we pay attention to and how we pay attention is key to what we create. What prevents us from attending to situations more effectively is that we aren't fully aware of and in touch with the inner place from which attention and intention originate. This is what Scharmer calls our blind spot. By moving through Scharmer's U process, we consciously access the blind spot and learn to connect to our authentic Self--the deepest source of knowledge and inspiration--in the realm of "presencing," a term coined by Scharmer that combines the concepts of presence and sensing. Based on ten years of research and action learning and interviews with over 150 practitioners and thought leaders, <i>Theory U</i> offers a rich diversity of compelling stories and examples and includes dozens of exercises and practices that allow leaders, and entire organizations, to shift awareness, connect with the best future possibility, and gain the ability to realize it.</p></p><h2>Christmas Cozy (Zoe Donovan Cozy Mystery)</h2><p>Christmas in Ashton Falls is always a magical time of year.

Kindergarten-Grade 2&#x2014;An ordinary dog who likes to do ordinary dog things ("running and panting, sniffing and growling, rolling in things, digging and howling") happens to notice a pretty little cat and promptly falls in love. He smiles; she notices his large teeth. He approaches; she retreats. He calls up to the tree where she's hiding, "I love you!" But what she hears is, "Woof, woof, woof, woof." His affectionate whispers sound very much like growls. It's only when he digs up a very special brass bone&#x2014;a trombone, in fact&#x2014;that he finds a way to communicate his love in a language she understands. This affectionate and funny story is told almost musically, in rhythmic (if occasionally uneven) verse by expert storyteller Weeks. Berry's exuberant collage illustrations spill over the pages, gorgeously chaotic and filled with heart.&#x2014;<i>Susan Weitz, formerly at Spencer-Van Etten School District, Spencer, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

"Just like that, it's over?"<p>Dr. Turabian closed the metal-covered chart with a decisive snap. "Well," he said, "if you want to call twenty-five rounds of radiation, nine months of chemo and two surgeries 'just like that.'" He took off his glasses and slid them into the pocket of his lab coat."I couldn't be happier with your tests. Everything's where we'd hoped and planned for it to be, right on schedule. Other than taking your immunotoxin every day, there's nothing more you have to do."</p><p>Miranda blinked, overwhelmed by the news. "I'm I don't know what to say." Was there a rule of etiquette in this situation? Thank you, Doctor? I love you?</p><p>"You don't have to say anything. I think you'll find getting better is a lot easier than being sick." He grinned. "Go. Grow your hair. Come back in three months and tell me you feel like a million bucks."</p><p>He left her alone, the heavy door of the exam room closing with a sigh. Miranda went through the motions of getting dressed, all the while mulling over her conversation with the doctor.</p><p>You're done.</p><p>I'm done.</p><p>Stick a fork in her, she's done.</p><p>After a year of this, Miranda didn't believe you could ever really be done with cancer. It could be done with you, though, as you lay on the medical examiner's table like a waxy victim in a crime show.</p><p>Snap out of it, she told herself. For once, the doctor's advice didn't make her skin crawl no precautions about nausea meds and gels and post-op limitations. Nothing like that. His advice was so simple it was scary. Get dressed and get on with your life.</p><p>She tore off the crinkly paper smock and wadded it up, crunching it into a small, tight ball between the palms of her hands and then making a rim shot to the wastebasket. Take that.</p><p>As she reached up to pull her bra off a hook, a familiar, unpleasant twinge shot up her right arm. The post-op sensations never seemed to end, although her doctor and surgeon assured her the tingling and numbness would eventually go away.</p><p>Which was as of a few minutes ago over.</p><p>She told herself she ought to be laughing aloud, singing "I Will Survive" at the top of her lungs, dancing down the corridors of the clinic and kissing everyone she passed. Unfortunately, that was the last thing she felt like doing. Maybe the news hadn't quite sunk in, because at the moment, she simply felt hollow and exhausted, like a shipwreck victim who'd had to swim ashore. She was alive, but the fight for survival had taken everything from her. It had changed her from the inside out, and this new woman, this gritty survivor, didn't quite know what to make of herself.</p><p>She turned to face the mirror,studying a body that didn't feel like her own anymore. A year ago, she'd been a reasonably attractive thirty-eight-year-old, comfortable in her size-10 body and all right, she might as well admit it downright vain about her long, auburn hair. During the months of treatment, however, she had learned to avoid mirrors. Despite the earnest reassurances of her friends, family, treatment team and support group, she never did learn to love what she saw there.</p><p>Some would say she'd lost her right breast and all her hair, but Miranda considered the term lost to be a misnomer. She knew exactly where her hair had gone all over the bed pillows, down the drain of the shower, in the teeth of her comb, all over the car and the sofa. Shedding hair had followed in her wake wherever she went. Her husband, Jacob, had actually woken up one day with strands of her wavy auburn hair in his mouth. Over the course of a few days, her scalp had started to tingle. Then it stung and all her hair had come out and it wasn't lost at all. It had simply become detached from her. She collected it in a Nordstrom's bag and put it in the trash.</p><p>As for the other thing she'd "lost" her breast well, she knew darn well where that had gone, too. During the surgery, the tissue had been ever so carefully bagged and tagged and sent to the hospital pathology lab for analysis. Her diagnosis was made by someone she'd never met, someone she would never know. Someone who had typed her fate onto a neat form: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, stage one, tumor size 1.5 cm, nodes 15 negative.</p><p>She was considered lucky because she was a candidate for TRAM flap breast reconstruction, which took place immediately following her mastectomy. A separate surgical team came in and created a new breast, using tissue from her stomach. She'd struggled to be matter-of-fact about her reconstructed breast, figuring that if she didn't make a big deal of it, then it wouldn't be a big deal. Even though her counselor and support group encouraged her to acknowledge that an important, defining part of her was gone, that her body was permanently altered, she had resisted. She claimed she hadn't been that enamored of her breasts in the first place. They simply were there. Size 34B. And after surgery, they still were, only the right one had been created with body fat from her stomach, something she didn't exactly mind losing. And the tattooed-on nipple was something of a novelty. How many women could boast about that?</p><p>Miranda knew she should be weeping with relief and gratitude just about now, but she still didn't like looking at herself in the mirror. The reconstructed breast seemed slightly offkilter, and although the skin tone and temperature were exactly the same as her other breast, she couldn't feel a thing there. Nothing,nada. And her belly button was pulled a bit to one side.</p><p>According to the members of her support group, she was supposed to look in the mirror and see a survivor. A phenomenal woman whose beauty shone from within. A woman who was glad to be alive.</p><p>Miranda leaned forward, looked carefully. Where was that woman?</p><p>Still in hiding, she thought. Her gorgeous self didn't want to come out to play.</p><p>After an agony of baldness, she was getting her hair back. Her brows and eyelashes. Unfortunately, the fledgling fuzz of hair on her head was just plain weird. She had a terrible feeling that it was coming in whitish gray. But it was her real actual hair, growing in strangely soft and baby fine, as though she had just hatched from an egg. Her skin was sallow, and new lines fanned outward from the corners of her eyes. The whites of her eyes were yellow. She still hid beneath hats, scarves and wigs. She didn't like looking like a cancer patient even though that was exactly what she was. Correction, she told herself. Cancer survivor, no longer a patient.</p><p>She turned away, grabbed her bra and finished dressing, pulling on her khaki twill pants and a front-button shirt. She disliked the twinges she felt whenever she pulled a shirt over her head. It was as though her body kept wanting to remind her that she'd been nipped, tucked and rearranged, and there wasn't a darn thing she could do about it. She slung her butter-yellow sweater around her shoulders and loosely tied it by the sleeves, knowing the morning chill would be gone by now. With a deliberate tug, she put on her hat. Today's accessory was a sun hat made of cotton duck, which she'd chosen for comfort rather than style.</p><p>She finished putting herself together handbag, cell phone, keys and walked through the now-familiar putty-colored hallway of the clinic.There was soothing Native American&#x2013;style artwork on the walls and soothing New Age music drifting from speakers in the ceiling. As usual, everyone here was busy, hurrying somewhere with a chart or heading into one of the exam rooms. And as usual, everyone she passed offered a distracted but sincere smile of encouragement.</p><p>The waiting room was a different story. There, patients seemed almost furtive as they studied magazines or checked the inboxes of their BlackBerries. It was almost as if they didn't want to make eye contact for fear of seeing something they shouldn't hope or despair or some combination of both in the eyes of another patient.</p><p>Miranda realized none of the people in the waiting room could know she was leaving the place for good. She wouldn't be back for three whole months, and then only for a checkup. Still, she felt an odd flicker of survivor guilt as she passed through the room, past the burbling tabletop fountain, the aspidistra plant that had doubled in size since she'd been coming here, the magazine rack, for the last time.</p><p>She stepped out into the dazzling sunshine of an Indian summer afternoon. For a moment it was so bright Miranda felt disoriented, as if she had lost her bearings. Then she blinked, dug out her sunglasses and put them on. The world came into view. Seattle in September was a place of matchless beauty, a time of warm, golden days, incredibly clear skies and crisp nights that held the snap of autumn in the air. Today had been graced with the kind of weather that made normally industrious people sit out on the patios of urban caf�s, sipping granitas and tilting their faces up to the sun.</p><p>From the hospital on First Hill also known as Pill Hill, thanks to the abundance of hospitals and medical centers in the area she could look toward the waterfront and see the bustle of downtown, with its disorganized tangle of freeways and the distinctive spike of the Space Needle rising above Elliott Bay. Farther in the distance lay Seattle's signature defining view deep blue Puget Sound lined by evergreen-clad islands and inlets, the horizon edged by mountains that appeared to be topped with blue-white whipped cream. It didn't matter whether you'd been born here as Miranda had or if you were a newcomer, Puget Sound dazzled the eye every time you looked at it.</p><p>A car horn blasted, causing her to jump back onto the curb. Whoops. She'd been so busy admiring the scenery that she hadn't been paying attention to the signals. She dutifully waited for the little green pedestrian man to tell her when it was safe to move forward. It would be incredibly ironic to survive cancer, only to get squashed by a bakery truck.</p><p>She hiked half a block t...</p></p><h2>A Prairie Girl&#39;s Faith: The Spiritual Legacy of Laura Ingalls Wilder</h2><p><b>The&nbsp;first in-depth look at the&nbsp;spiritual path of legendary storyteller Laura Ingalls Wilder.</b><br><br>With her extraordinary God-given pluck, the creator of the epic Little House series survived the harshness of frontier life&#x2014;from the heartbreak of sudden crop losses to murderous storms to unrelenting loneliness.

Throughout the eight original titles there are, in the foreground, references to Scripture, hymns, and prayer&#x2014;to a daily life that experienced the reality of God.</p><p>We are no more than twenty-three pages into the first title, Little House in the Big Woods, before Pa is playing his fiddle from which poured such standards as &#x201c;Rock of Ages,&#x201d; &#x201c;On Jordan&#x2019;s Stormy Banks I Stand,&#x201d; and &#x201c;A Shelter in the Time of Storm,&#x201d; songs that were in the hymnals of my youth but are seldom found sixty years later.</p><p>To find the roots of Laura&#x2019;s faith we must, of course, discover what we can about the spiritual journey of her parents, Charles and Caroline.</p><p>The Family That Travels Together Stays Together</p><p>Fortunately, Dr. John E. Miller, professor emeritus of history at South Dakota State University, has noted their journey and gives us some insights into early Ingalls and Quiner (Ma Ingalls) beginnings. Any recounting would be almost a blank without his work, but even he cannot tell us everything. (For example, we know that Ma&#x2019;s father drowned in Lake Michigan when Ma was only four, but we do not really know the overall effect this had on her.)</p><p>What Miller does tell us is that both the Ingalls and Quiner families, along with many other families of their day, saw almost all their hopes for economic gain to be in traveling west. There needed to be a movement from the crowded East into the vastness of the &#x201c;wilderness.&#x201d; Their faith and family backgrounds certainly went with them on the journey.</p><p>Grandma and Grandpa Ingalls (Laura and Lansford) migrated all the way from Cuba, New York, to the woods of Wisconsin. Both of them would have grown up in a sort of mixed Puritan and Congregational background common to the times. They would have considered themselves in the mainstream of Protestantism of that day, with elements of reformational teaching of the Bible as an absolute authority on doctrine, supplemented by attitudes that came out of the Great Awakening led by Jonathan Edwards (1703&#x2013;1758).</p><p>Edwards believed, in part, that God was wrathful and impatient toward sinners and ready to kick butt, so to speak. Later revivalists of the era following the Civil War were more likely to emphasize God&#x2019;s love and mercy as reasons to live the Christian life.</p><p>The background for Henry and Charlotte Quiner (Ma and Pa Quiner) was much the same, except that during their migrations they spent time in Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois before ending up near Pepin, Wisconsin, which is near the border with Minnesota.</p><p>The Quiner and Ingalls families were neighbors, which most likely explains how Caroline and Charles met. They were married on February 1, 1860, in Pepin and were still residing there when their first child, Mary, was born in 1865. Laura came next on February 7, 1867.</p><p>Later in the family&#x2019;s story the Congregational Church was to become a happy home for both Charles and Caroline Ingalls, but during these years in Pepin we know only of a Methodist church in the town.</p><p>What we do know is that Pa and Ma and the girls lived about seven miles from town, and it is unlikely any formal Christian schooling began there. More likely Pa played the music for the hymns they learned, and Ma likely conducted Bible study and helped the girls memorize Scripture verses. Over time Laura learned by heart over a hundred Bible verses.</p><p>Ma was a gentle instructor and wanted her children to be good, both in the sense of being obedient, as well as acting properly, as was expected of young ladies. She applied that old rule that said women had the responsibility for maintaining community standards for sobriety and honesty. Some men thought that feminine nature civilized their &#x201c;natural&#x201d; unruliness.</p><p>We have the Little House books themselves to testify to these goals. Laura is told not to be selfish but to share her doll with others. Mary gets away with a certain amount of meanness by knowing just how to play the game of being good, but she torments Laura about her plain brown hair and bosses her around. Mary is also good at not being caught, but Laura is never very good at hiding her misbehavior.</p><p>In Little House in the Big Woods, Laura rebels against all the rules connected with Sunday. In fact, she declares that she hates Sunday. This is a pretty bold statement for any child of that age to make, and Pa has to gather Laura tenderly to himself and tell her of how his own father and his brothers had disobeyed and snuck out on a Sunday to play on a sled. A squealing pig gave away the misdeed when they struck it as they were careening down a hill. They were caught in the act, and the punishment followed.</p><p>Pa tells Laura that those times in his youth were even stricter for girls, who weren&#x2019;t allowed to run outside and play at all. When Laura falls asleep, it is to the sound of her father&#x2019;s fiddle playing hymns such as &#x201c;Rock of Ages.&#x201d; His counsel has given her at least some comfort.</p><p>Laura was what I would call &#x201c;God conscious&#x201d; from early on in her life. From the manuscript of an early version of Laura&#x2019;s autobiography entitledPioneer Girl, edited by Pamela Smith Hill, we learn that Laura as a child was warned of the dangers of licking icicles&#x2014;one might fall on a girl&#x2019;s head and injure her. Laura at first obeyed the rule but gave in little by little until she licked an icicle and then felt terribly guilty about it because she had disobeyed Ma. Her heart ached for days over what she had done before she finally confessed to Ma. Here&#x2019;s what happened next, as quoted inPioneer Girl:</p><p>It was such a comfort to tell her [Ma] all about it. She smoothed my hair and said of course she would forgive me, because I had told her I was sorry and that now I must say a little prayer and ask God to forgive me too. She told me to say &#x201c;Dear God please forgive me for telling a lie?&#x201d; [sic] And when I did, Ma said she was sure I would never be so naughty again, then she tucked me in kissed me and went away. The fiddle was singing again as I went to sleep.</p><p>In 1868 when Laura was just a year old, the family moved from Wisconsin to Kansas Territory. Since Laura was still so young, Ma and Pa would have continued to guide her spiritual formation. In fact, all the information we have on this time comes from the memories of Pa and Ma, who related them later to Laura when she could understand them.</p><p>Sundays would have been observed at home, as they lived thirteen miles from the nearest town of Independence, Kansas. The &#x201c;now I lay me down to sleep&#x201d; prayers would have been said to the sound of coyotes barking and wolves howling in the company of the lonely dark. The fact is, the struggles inherent in the pioneer life tended to drive most folk to a dependence on God. It aided in character development to have a little fear of the wild. One wanted to be independent and to achieve success, but it helped when a neighbor was handy. The elements of nature were certainly out of one&#x2019;s control, and a thunderstorm or prairie downpour was often thought of as a frightening act of God.</p><p>I do not mean to suggest by all this that the little family on the prairie was perfect. Hardly. They shared the same prejudice toward the Native Americans as did many other settlers. And it would have been advanced religious thinking indeed for them to realize the European and the true American were brothers under the skin. Here and there an occasional missionary might speak against injustices to the Indians. Indeed, a number of Office of Indian Affairs agents spoke up against the way their &#x201c;charges&#x201d; were treated.</p><p>But the doctrine of Manifest Destiny&#x2014;that the white man had a right to all the territory across America to the Pacific&#x2014;was well established. Laura and Mary were instructed to never let their dog, Jack, loose when Indians were around, but we never hear Pa saying they should never have moved into Indian Territory in the first place. No, I&#x2019;m afraid many a pioneer felt that God must be white or like Holman Hunt&#x2019;s painting of the time, which showed a rather Gentile-looking Christ knocking at heart&#x2019;s door.</p><p>Naturally, the pioneers sought the help of God, even though their choice to move and live in an often harsh frontier environment was the reason they were in harm&#x2019;s way. Certainly, the beloved hymns of the nineteenth century reminded them that God was a defense and shelter, and Pa would have played many a tune on his fiddle to keep the spirits of his family up.</p><p>Pa had his hopes. He was certainly counting on the government to declare the Indian land open to settlement, and history would have led him to believe this would happen, so his wait-and-see attitude made some sense.</p><p>At their crude cabin in Indian Territory, the family was too far away from Independence to visit, except to gather supplies. That journey was always made by Pa. Ma Ingalls and the children were left virtually isolated from civilization. A twenty-six-mile round trip with three small children (Carrie was born there in 1870) would have been nearly impossible and certainly not undertaken on a weekly basis to attend church.</p><p>Even if Ma and Pa could have made the trip, the churches in Independence&#x2014;most likely Methodist or Baptist&#x2014;might not have been a good fit for them. At this point in their lives, Methodism might well have been a bit too emotional, and the Baptist faith just hadn&#x2019;t been in their past experience at all. (Ironically, in later life Laura did become a Methodist, but her appreciation for privacy in religious expression never changed.)</p><p>The Family That Makes Music Together Stays Together</p><p>The Ingalls family most likely found emotional release from the tensions of their frontier situation in the old hymns of the church. The songs of a writer like Charles Wesley would have indeed provided a welcome relief and been found in any hymnal. Familiar verses such as these, from various hymns, would have brought much comfort and encouragement:</p><p>O for a thousand tongues to sing</p><p>My great Redeemer&#x2019;s praise.</p><p>Love divine, all loves excelling,</p><p>Joy of heaven to earth come down.</p><p>And can it be that I should gain</p><p>An interest in the Savior&#x2019;s blood?</p><p>The certainties of one&#x2019;s heavenly home go far when each new day can bring new peril.Little House on the Prairie tells of one instance when the family was awakened by the terrible screams of a panther prowling near the Verdigris River. Pa&#x2019;s singing helped calm his family&#x2019;s fears.</p><p>Dr. Dale Cockrell, former Vanderbilt professor of musicology and American and southern studies, has noted that music from Pa&#x2019;s fiddle played a key role in developing the Ingalls family&#x2019;s identity and unity. InThe Happy Land Companion, written to supplement information for his CDs containing songs sung by the Ingalls family, he reported that there are at least 126 songs in the Little House series, with references to hundreds of other tunes scattered throughout the eight books. He noted,</p><p>There are parlor songs, stage songs, minstrel show songs, patriotic songs, Scottish and Irish songs, hymns, spirituals, fiddle tunes, singing school songs, play party songs, folk songs, a Child ballad, broadside ballads, Christmas songs, catches and rounds, and references to &#x201c;cowboy songs&#x201d; and &#x201c;Osage war dances.&#x201d; Throughout, the guiding musical spirit is her father Charles Ingalls (1835&#x2013;1902), a musician who passed up few opportunities to sing and play his fiddle. It is &#x201c;Pa&#x2019;s fiddle,&#x201d; carefully wrapped, stowed in its fiddle-box and cushioned by pillows, that accompanies the Ingalls family through all its adventures and comes to symbolize the endurance of the family unit in an often wild and threatening frontier world.</p><p>As the family camped on the Kansas prairie, waiting to see if the Osage Indians would agree to release their land to the American government, Pa kept the family singing. Hymns gave promise of rest and security, if not now, then &#x201c;In the Sweet By and By.&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a land that is fairer than day,</p><p>And by faith we can see it afar;</p><p>For the Father waits over the way</p><p>To prepare us a dwelling place there.</p><p>In the sweet by and by</p><p>We shall meet on that beautiful shore;</p><p>In the sweet by and by</p><p>We shall meet on that beautiful shore.</p><p>On the lighter side, Pa seems to have been the merry prankster of the family, and he used his extensive fiddle repertoire to keep family spirits high. The humorous tune &#x201c;The Arkansas Traveler&#x201d; is referenced in more than one Little House book. It was certainly played during their Kansas sojourn, for it was one of Pa&#x2019;s favorite comedic tunes.</p><p>The music itself has no words, but the accompanying story, which is related when the fiddler pauses, tells of a weary traveler who needs shelter during a rainy night. When he asks a man living in an old shack for directions to the nearest town, the homeowner tells him he&#x2019;s never been that way and doesn&#x2019;t know what lies beyond. When the traveler notices that the shack is leaking in every corner, he asks the owner why he doesn&#x2019;t fix the roof. The owner replies that he doesn&#x2019;t need to fix it when it isn&#x2019;t raining and to fix it when it is raining is foolish. The dialogue goes on like this until at last the weary traveler moves on.</p><p>Perhaps the most-played lighthearted melody of the time was &#x201c;Captain Jinks.&#x201d; The song is referenced many times in Laura&#x2019;s remembrance of pioneer days. Interestingly enough, for such a religious family, the Ingalls rejoiced at Captain Jinks, who seemed to have no scruples at all.</p><p>Jinks at first admits that he feeds &#x201c;[his] horse on corn and beans and sport[s] young ladies in their &#x2019;teens,&#x201d; though he is too old to be anybody&#x2019;s beau. By the second verse we find out he&#x2019;s &#x201c;not cut out for the army&#x201d; because he can&#x2019;t stand the discipline. He also admits to disgracefully having run from the enemy in battle. And his officers want to &#x201c;kick him out of the army.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>A General Selection from the Works of Sigmund Freud</h2><p>Freud&#39;s writings disclose the origin, development, and dynamics of psychoanalysis together with probing narcissism, melancholia, group psychology, and the ego and the id</p><p></p><h2>The New Lottie Moon Story</h2><p>Lottie Moon is a legend among Southern Baptist.

Selling is not a career or a job for a few, but a MUST in order to solicit support from others, get and keep a job, build, a company, get a promotion, get a loan, raise money, buy or sell a house, get elected, hire great people and ultimately to make your dreams come true. Readers are saying, &#34;This is the first new information written on selling in fifty years!&#34; Selling is not a career but a prerequisite for creating any level of success. Selling the Secret to Success is a fast read, loaded with specific actions you can take in the &#34;real world&#34; that will get you where you want to go! The author, Grant Cardone, is a self made American Rag to Riches story of the 21st Century, who will show you exactly how to sell your products, your ideas and your dreams to make your goals a reality. This is some of what others are saying: &#34;I just finished reading, Selling the Secret to Success and it is the single best book on Selli</p><p>Grant Cardone is the entrepreneur for the 21st Century. Starting from nothing, he is founder and owner of three multi-million dollar companies: a successful software company, a sales training and consulting business, and a real estate company with a portfolio valued at over 100 million dollars. Cardone also speaks internationally to industry leaders, managers, CEOs and entrepreneurs on sales, money, finance, business strategies and business expansion. The author of Selling The Secret to Success, Cardone's recently released first book stresses the importance of selling to any career. "While the business schools suggest that undercapitalization is the number one reason a business fails," says Cardone, "the ONLY reason a business or individual actually fails is the inability to sell their products, services and ideas in quantities great enough to fund the company or individual." <p>Cardone has a proven track record in the development of revolutionary and pioneering techniques that have been validated for creating wealth and success. Cardone made his first impact in the business world when he literally rewrote the sales methodologies used by the automotive industry. It became obvious to him that long held sales strategies were ultimately ineffective and in need of change so he created Information Assisted SellingTM, a series of consumer driven applications that enable dealerships to effectively service customers by making the buying process painless, fast and professional. His approaches are now endorsed by the most successful automobile dealers around the world and most of the major manufacturers. </p><p>As a real estate investor, Cardone started with one home and parlayed it into apartments, shopping centers and development opportunities with over 200 million dollars bought and sold. One of the few voices who reject the constant negative media drumbeat about the economy and in particular, the state of the national housing market, Cardone offers his expertise on a number of current issues: </p><p> Lending -- While all the pundits are saying that loans aren't available to the residential consumer, Cardone affirms the availability of sound financing in a market brimming with opportunity. </p><p> Sub Prime -- Concerning the sub prime loan crisis, Cardone points the finger at the builders who negotiated fraudulent loans, thus creating the current mortgage crisis, not the consumers taking on adjustable loans. </p><p> Residential Real Estate - Cardone believes this to be the best real estate opportunity in the last 25 years and suggests that America is ON SALE. </p><p> Home Buying Tips -- Cardone's three basic tips to buying real estate are also discussed in the video: Home Buying Tips Video by Grant Cardone. Among his tips that buck conventional wisdom is his contention that it doesn't always make sense to buy the least expensive home but rather the "trophy property" in the neighborhood. By implementing Cardone's simple formulas, thousands of individuals have flourished in the ebb and flow of an ever-changing real estate market. </p><p> Gas Prices -- Cardone has also been focusing on what the media refers to as the 'gas crisis.' Although he realizes the price of fuel is causing concern and pain for many Americans, Cardone believes the 'crisis' is a bit exaggerated. Pointing out that Americans have paid below world prices for years, not just for gas but for food and housing as well, Cardone says Americans must become more disciplined when it comes to how they use gas, electricity and shopping. Among the tips he puts forth is that we must use our cars like a piece of equipment that serves to increase our production. Americans must calculate their exact increase in fuel expenditures so that they are aware of the exact amount of additional revenue that their lifestyles require. $4 Gas Solution by Grant Cardone</p></p><h2>Diving Into The Wreck: Poems 1971-1972</h2><p><p><strong>In this reissue of her seventh volume of poetry, Adrienne Rich searches to reclaim&#x2015;to discover&#x2015;what has been forgotten, lost, or unexplored.</strong></p> "I came to explore the wreck. / The words are purposes. / The words are maps. / I came to see the damage that was done / and the treasures that prevail."

This selection of Chomsky's essays and lectures comes divided into geographical areas, but the issues are global in scope and import. In dissecting the rhetoric and logic of American empire and class domination, at home and abroad, Chomsky continues a longstanding and crucial work of elucidation and activism. His latest updates elaborate upon his signature themes&#x2014;the double standards applied by the centers of U.S. power, including the mainstream media and intellectual culture, and the pervasive disconnect between American policies and public opinion in what Chomsky dubs a dysfunctional democracy. But this book flags another major interest of Chomsky's, signaled in the title: global avenues of resistance, in particular the democratic and independent course being forged across Latin America (where several of these lectures were originally delivered). There are significant redundancies and polemical flourishes, but the writing remains unswervingly rational and principled throughout, and lends bracing impetus to the real alternatives before us. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From the 1893 World's Fair to Body Shop advertisements, di Leonardo focuses on the intimate and shifting relations between popular portrayals of exotic Others and the practice of anthropology. In so doing, she casts new light on gender, race, and the public sphere in America's past and present.<br><br>"An impressive work of scholarship that is mordantly witty, passionately argued, and takes no prisoners."&#x2014;Lesley Gill, <i>News Politics</i><br><br>"[Micaela] di Leonardo eloquently argues for the importance of empirical, interdisciplinary social science in addressing the tragedy that is urban America at the end of the century."&#x2014;Jonathan Spencer, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"In her quirky new contribution to the American culture brawl, feminist anthropologist Micaela di Leonardo explains how anthropologists, 'technicians of the sacred,' have distorted American popular debate and social life."&#x2014;Rachel Mattson, <i>Voice Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"At the end of di Leonardo's analyses one is struck by her rare combination of rigor and passion. Simply, [she] is a marvelous iconoclast."&#x2014;Matthew T. McGuire, <i>Boston Book Review</i></p><p>The title refers simultaneously to American anthropologists and the domestic subjects they most often study: ethnic minorities and women. As evidenced by new retail chains such as Anthropologie, the public and the media often perceive anthropologists as what the author refers to as "guardians of the offbeat." Similarly, women and minorities are often viewed both by anthropologists and the public as "temporally distant" primitives. In this work, di Leonardo (anthropology and women's studies, Northwestern Univ.) presents an in-depth, fascinating history of the changing political context and public personae of American anthropology. Unlike recent histories such as Curtis Hinsley's Savages and Scientists (Smithsonian Institution, 1981), which focuses on anthropology's changing theoretical paradigms, di Leonardo concerns herself with how anthropologists are perceived by the public and portrayed by the media. Although written in sometimes cryptic academic language, this is an engaging study. Recommended for large public libraries with strong social science departments and academic anthropology collections.?Jim Woodman, Boston Athenaeum<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Proud Highway 1955-67, Saga of a Desperate Southern Gentleman : Fear and Loathing Letters</h2><p>This is Hunter Thompson&#39;s perception of the 1960s as told through his letters from 1955 to 1967 (age 17 to 29). Addicted to drugs and alcohol at the time, Thompson&#39;s rage and drug-taking derived from his understanding of how much better the world could be, yet how little he could do to improve it.</p><p>This first volume of the correspondence of Hunter S. Thompson begins with a high school essay and runs up through the publication of Thompson's breakout book, <i>Hell's Angels</i>. Thompson apparently never threw a letter away, so the reader has the treat of experiencing the full evolution of his pyrotechnic writing style, rant by rant. The letters--to girlfriends, to bill collectors, to placers of "Help Wanted" ads, to editors and publishers--are usually spiced with political commentary. The style and the political animus always seem to drive each other. For instance, an 11/22/63 letter to novelist and friend William J. Kennedy about the day's cataclysm is apparently the birthplace of the signal phrase "fear and loathing." (Thompson summed up the Kennedy assassination thus: "The savage nuts have shattered the great myth of American decency.") And the willingness to write strangers is stunning: this collection includes Thompson's letter to LBJ seeking appointment to the governorship of American Samoa. You might have thought Garry Trudeau was exaggerating in his <i>Doonesbury</i> characterization of the Thompson-based character Duke. He was not.I recommended this one to my twenty-five-year old brother. Some of what I saw inside the book seemed to cater to his sense of humor and his desire for the truth. He loved it.

His daughter Emma Straub is author of <em>Laura Lamont's Life in Pictures</em>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Peter: </strong>Ben, <em>Red Moon</em> exists on the borderlands--beyond genre, but clearly playing in the world of horror and thrillers. Was this your intention when you started to write the novel?</p> <p><strong>Ben: </strong>I grew up on genre. Reading westerns, sci-fi, fantasy, spy thrillers. Reading horror especially. Your novels had a profound impact on me. So did the work of Stephen King and Robert R. McCammon and Anne Rice and Dan Simmons. When I took my first creative writing workshop as an undergrad, I felt so confused and affronted when the instructor said genre would be forbidden. I threw up my hand and very earnestly asked, "But what else <em>is</em> there?"</p> <p>That semester, I fell in love with "literary" writers like Sherman Alexie and Alice Munro and Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and Raymond Carver, but I never fell out of love with "genre." In fact, I missed its compulsive readability. I put "literary" and "genre" in quotation marks, because I'm getting more and more irritated with the designations, the need everyone feels to pin labels and distinguish one kind of story from another. If you look at Larry McMurtry's <em>Lonesome Dove</em> or Margaret Atwood&#x2019;s <em>Oryx and Crake</em> or Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s <em>The Road</em> or your very own <em>Ghost Story</em>, they are neither fish nor fowl, both literary and genre. Pretty sentences, unforgettable characters, subterranean themes, rip-roaring plots. In writing <em>Red Moon</em> I was attempting to follow your tracks in the mud. To write a novel that was both thought provoking, artfully constructed, and thrilling.</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> <em>Red Moon</em> taps into what we fear now--physically, politically, and personally. How did you come up with the idea of transporting the werewolf myth to America's war on terror?</p> <p><strong>Ben: </strong>Some of the most resonant, lasting horror stories are those that channel cultural unease. Consider <em>Frankenstein</em> as a prime example. The way the creature embodies all the anxieties brought on by the Industrial Revolution: the fear of science and technology, of man playing God. The Red Scare gave rise to <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em>. Cold War anxieties are the platform for <em>The Dead Zone</em>. I was thinking about this--what we fear now--when I sat down to write <em>Red Moon</em>.</p> <p><strong>Peter:</strong> In the novel, you use the term "lycan" instead on "werewolf." What does the word "lycan" evoke for you that the classic word does not?</p> <p><strong>Ben: </strong>Werewolves have a rich mythology, and I wanted to honor that tradition while making it new, making it my own. I think this is why Justin Cronin uses the term virals (instead of vampires) in <em>The Passage</em> and why Robert Kirkman calls them walkers (instead of zombies) in <em>The Walking Dead</em>.</p> <p>So lycan--short for lycanthropy, the psychological condition that makes you believe you can transform into a wolf--is one small sleight of hand that hints at the larger sorcery of the novel. My lycans are not full-moon howlers. They are infected with lobos, an animal-borne pathogen. Prions (the basis of Mad Cow and Chronic Wasting disease) are misfolded proteins that target the brain--and target in this novel rage and sexual impulse. I interviewed researchers at the USDA and Iowa State University to figure out the slippery science of this condition and create a believable horror.</p> <p><strong>Peter: </strong>The plot of <em>Red Moon</em> follows three interlocking strands and moves at a breakneck pace, often jumping ahead in time and letting the reader play catch up. Why did you structure the novel this way?</p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> I&#x2019;ve always loved epic, sweeping novels. Everything from TH White&#x2019;s <em>The Once and Future King</em> to Stephen King&#x2019;s <em>The Stand</em> to Gabriel Garcia Marquez&#x2019;s <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>. <em>Red Moon</em> is a hefty book: it follows many characters over many years in many different places. The trick, when orchestrating something so complicated, is grabbing the reader&#x2019;s attention and never letting go.</p> <p>Long before I begin writing, I rip a long sheet of paper from my children's art easel and hang it from my office wall and begin to brainstorm. I sketch out plot points. I draw and build histories and emotional arcs for characters. I know that some writers prefer a more organic process, but my own feeling is, you don&#x2019;t build a cathedral without a set of blueprints.</p> <p>Over the top of the blueprint I sketch out a kind of cardiogram or seismograph in order to understand the spikes and dips in tension. I often move plot points around--sometimes withholding information for several chapters--in order to create different layers of tension and strategically organize explosive and revelatory moments.</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> My dad and I write very different types of books. Why do you think <em>Red Moon</em> appeals to both of us? Do you think there are some kinds of stories that appeal to all of us? Is it that werewolves, no matter how advanced or violent, have a whiff of our childhood fairytales?</p> <p><strong>Ben: </strong>Whiff of childhood fairytales. I like that. If there is ever a <em>Red Moon</em> perfume, instead of <em>eau de toilette</em>, I think it should be labeled as whiff of werewolf.</p> <p>In <em>Red Moon</em>, I explore the evil hidden with all of us and within society. The werewolf myth resonates because we have all--as a result of rage or exhaustion or drugs or alcohol--come to regret our behavior the next morning. This is the story of Jekyll and Hyde, the story of the Incredible Hulk, an unleashed id, the wildness crouched inside all of us. If only bad guys all looked like Darth Vader. Instead the sex offender, the serial killer, the terrorist could be the guy who lives next door, and that's scary as hell, the realization that we're all different degrees of hairy on the inside.</p> <strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2013</strong>: On its surface, <em>Red Moon</em> is a book about werewolves, providing an alternate history behind the origins and growth of the werewolf population. At its core, however, this strikingly imaginative and terrifically detailed fantasy is about much more than werewolves. Dig deeper, and it operates on two very potent levels. It's an allegory that tears down the wall between fantasy and reality, using a creature to represent an unspecified people struggling for equal rights (perhaps of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disease, disability). It is also a reminder of our imperfect history, a snapshot of our volatile present, and a warning of a potentially dark future--where fear begets prejudice and prejudice begets policy. Among the werewolves, there are the amicable, the righteous, and the extremist. Likewise there are humans who coexist with their lycan neighbors, some of them peaceful, some of them oppressive. In bringing them all together, Percy creates a political parable that doesn't lecture, but equips us with the ability to examine the quagmire of cultural conflict from a safe, fictional distance. -<em>-Robin A.

It was consequently vital that there be somewhere to hide when the pursuivants came battering at the door. One name is prominent in the construction of priest-holes &#x2012; that of Nicholas Owen. A very short and later crippled man, he built the majority of these shelters, so saving the lives of untold numbers of priests and fugitives. His early apprenticeship as a joiner and his knowledge of construction served him well as he burrowed into walls and constructed near-invisible entrance holes. Although a well-known figure in Recusant studies, and almost invariably mentioned in histories of the Gunpowder Plot, this is his first detailed biography. St Nicholas Owen was born in Oxford, the son of a carpenter. Two of his brothers were to train as Catholic priests on the continent. A third, Henry, the first apprentice at what was to become the Oxford University Press, went on to assist the Mission with the production of Catholic books and pamphlets. Nicholas was himself apprenticed to an Oxford joiner in 1577. Acting as a servant to Fr Henry Garnet SJ for nearly twenty years, Owen had many adventures, narrowly evading capture, and assisted in the escape of the Jesuit Fr John Gerard from the Tower of London in 1597. St Nicholas was tortured at the Poultry Compter in 1594 but later released. He was finally taken in one of his own priest-holes during the rigorous pursuit of Catholics that followed the failure of the Gunpowder Plot, and died upon the rack in the Tower of London in 1606. Evidence of St Nicholas Owen's work is still visible in country houses and mansions across England, and recent research has unveiled greater detail of his fascinating career assisting the English Mission at the close of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries. Tony Reynolds read Architecture at University College London in the 'sixties, and became interested in the application of computers to architecture, then very much in its pioneering stages. A staunch member of the caving club at college, this love of confined spaces combined with his architectural training may have given him special insight into the construction of priest-holes. Working as a computer manager and resident programmer, he has published several textbooks on computer use by architects, and, most recently, a well-received book of pastiche Sherlock Holmes stories.</p><p></p><h2>Shellfish - Chinese Style Made Easy</h2><p>Here is the ultimate resource for the preparation of delectable, exotic, easy to prepare seafood dishes.

It describes corruption and imperial bigotry in a society where, &#39;after all, natives were natives - interesting, no doubt, but finally ... an inferior people&#39;. When Flory, a white timber merchant, befriends Indian Dr Veraswami, he defies this orthodoxy. The doctor is in danger: U Po Kyin, a corrupt magistrate, is plotting his downfall. The only thing that can save him is membership of the all-white Club, and Flory can help. Flory&#39;s life is changed further by the arrival of beautiful Elizabeth Lackersteen from Paris, who offers an escape from loneliness and the &#39;lie&#39; of colonial life. George Orwell&#39;s first novel, inspired by his experiences in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma, Burmese Days includes a new introduction by Emma Larkin in Penguin Modern Classics.</p><p>Imagine crossing E.M. Forster with Jane Austen. Stir in a bit of socialist doctrine, a sprig of satire, strong Indian curry, and a couple quarts of good English gin and you get something close to the flavor of George Orwell's intensely readable and deftly plotted <i>Burmese Days</i>. In 1930, Kyauktada, Upper Burma, is one of the least auspicious postings in the ailing British Empire--and then the order comes that the European Club, previously for whites only, must elect one token native member. This edict brings out the worst in this woefully enclosed society, not to mention among the natives who would become the One. Orwell mines his own Anglo-Indian background to evoke both the suffocating heat and the stifling pettiness that are the central facts of colonial life: "Mr. MacGregor told his anecdote about Prome, which could be produced in almost any context. And then the conversation veered back to the old, never-palling subject--the insolence of the natives, the supineness of the Government, the dear dead days when the British Raj <i>was</i> the Raj and please give the bearer fifteen lashes. The topic was never let alone for long, partly because of Ellis's obsession. Besides, you could forgive the Europeans a great deal of their bitterness. Living and working among Orientals would try the temper of a saint."<p> Protagonist James Flory is a timber merchant, whose facial birthmark serves as an outward expression of the ironic and left-leaning habits of mind that make him inwardly different from his coevals. Flory appreciates the local culture, has native allegiances, and detests the racist machinations of his fellow Club members. Alas, he doesn't always possess the moral courage, or the energy, to stand against them. His almost embarrassingly Anglophile friend, Dr. Veraswami, the highest-ranking native official, seems a shoo-in for Club membership, until Machiavellian magistrate U Po Kyin launches a campaign to discredit him that results, ultimately, in the loss not just of reputations but of lives. Whether to endorse Veraswami or to betray him becomes a kind of litmus test of Flory's character.</p><p> Against this backdrop of politics and ethics, Orwell throws the shadow of romance. The arrival of the bobbed blonde, marriageable, and resolutely anti-intellectual Elizabeth Lackersteen not only casts Flory as hapless suitor but gives Orwell the chance to show that he's as astute a reporter of nuanced social interactions as he is of political intrigues. In fact, his combination of an astringently populist sensibility, dead-on observations of human behavior, formidable conjuring skills, and no-frills prose make for historical fiction that stands triumphantly outside of time. <i>--Joyce Thompson</i></p>In this caustic, fast-paced novel about the waning days of British imperialism, George Orwell draws on his years of experience in India, the country of his birth. The story focuses on a handful of Englishmen living in a small settlement in Upper Burma. They congregate in the European Club, drinking whiskey and arguing over an impending order to admit a token Asian.</p><h2>Homoeopathic Materia Medica of Sarcodes</h2><p>The study of Sarcodes is one of the most grey areas of homoeopathic materia medica, which has not yet been thoroughly explored, The authors of this book have presented the profile of each sarcode in a schematic manner, focusing on its background, source, preparation, proving, sphere of action applicable clinic conditions, characteristic features, symptomatology, suitable dose &amp; potency, comparable medicines and experiences of the reputed clinicians with the particular sarcode.</p><p></p><h2>Watercolor: Go with the Flow</h2><p>Stresses the importance of detailed sketches, introduces the open-flow method of watercolor painting, and shows a variety of works</p><p></p><h2>DK Readers L2: LEGO Kingdoms: Defend the Castle</h2><p><p>Visit the Lion King's castle and find out who wants to attack the kingdom in this Level 2 reader from <i>DK, LEGO� Kingdoms: Defend the Castle!</i></p></p><p></p><h2>The Money Class: Learn to Create Your New American Dream</h2><p>What does it take to create your New American Dream? <br><br>Suze Orman, the woman millions of Americans have turned to for financial advice, says it&#x2019;s time for a serious reconsideration of the American Dream&#x2014;what promise it still holds, what aspects are in need of revision, and how it must be refashioned to fit our lives so that we can once again have faith that our hard work will pay off and that a secure and hopeful future is within our reach.<br>&nbsp;<br>In nine electrifying chapters, Orman delivers a master class on personal finance for this pivotal moment in time.

As a concept, it is so ingrained in our collective imagination that it doesn&#x2019;t even need to be defined, right? Think about it: Did you ever need to have it explained to you? My guess is you did not and that even from a young age, you, like me, knew it represented a promise&#x2014;of opportunity, of possibility&#x2014;that came with being American.<br> &nbsp;<br> But on closer inspection, it is not just an American impulse that the American Dream describes, it is a human one, and it unites us. No matter your socioeconomic, ethnic, or religious background, we all aspire to the same things: We seek to provide for our family and keep them safe, no matter what shape that family takes, no matter if we are talking about our parents or our children, a blended family or a family &#x201c;by choice,&#x201d; not blood. We want future generations to have even more opportunity than we ourselves have, a dream that is intrinsically linked with education and the advancement that follows from it. We want to live in a home that is secure in every sense&#x2014;as a haven for our loved ones and as a wise place to have spent our money. We want the guarantee that our hard work will pay off, that it will support us financially, that it will allow us to achieve our goals, and that when it is time to stop working, we will reap the benefits of those years of dedicated service and live out the rest of our lives comfortably in retirement.<br> &nbsp;<br> As universal as these desires are, we refer to them as the American Dream because for centuries this country has, for the most part, been able to make good on this promise of America as the land of opportunity. This belief has played a defining role in shaping our national psyche. It is at the heart of our Declaration of Independence&#x2014;that we each possess &#x201c;certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> How truly terrifying, then, to take stock of the American Dream today and to question the truth of it&#x2014;to wonder if it still exists in reality or if it has become an illusion, a myth. Take a look around: As of October 2011, nearly 14 million Americans were out of work; another 8.9 million were working only part-time because they cannot find full-time employment. That is nearly 23 million people who are struggling to make ends meet. Many of those lucky enough to still be employed in their 60s are looking to hang on to their jobs as long as possible because they simply cannot afford to retire&#x2014;which also means there are fewer job openings for young people entering the workforce.<br> &nbsp;<br> In many areas of the country, the dream of homeownership has backfired. Real estate values have deflated to such an extent that a record number of people owe more than their homes are worth. That&#x2019;s not an American Dream&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a nightmare.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because of the dire economic conditions of recent years, many parents are unable to afford the high cost of college tuition for their children. And there is a record number of student loans in default, making people question whether they ever should have taken them on to begin with.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sum total of all these facts and figures? The home, the job security, the education, the retirement&#x2014;the very standard of living that all of us took for granted for so long is completely under siege.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether we speak about it or not, we are grappling with the frightening possibility, the fear, that we no longer live in a land where effort applied to opportunity produces a better life. The doors leading to more and greater things, once wide open, now seem to be closing. It is hard to move up in an economy where there has been no job or wage growth over the past decade. Once a manufacturing powerhouse&#x2014;&#x201c;Made in the U.S.A.&#x201d; was our calling card&#x2014;we have ceded that engine of growth, and the jobs that go with it, to other countries as our own economy now relies on our ability to consume, not produce.<br> &nbsp;<br> The impact of these economic shifts has been felt deeply within our homes. While the median household income for adults born in the 1960s is indeed higher than the income of their parents&#x2019; generation, much of that is a function of smaller household size and the fact that there are now likely two wage earners per household. It takes more of us working more to maintain our forward progress. Even so, the pace of our growth has slowed considerably. According to a study commissioned by the Pew Charitable Trusts, family income doubled in the postwar years, between 1947 and 1973, but in the three decades since then the increase has been a mere 20%. That statistic provides important context to why household debt relative to income more than doubled over the same period: For many, borrowing was a way to keep up with our parents and grandparents. To put it in more emotional terms, it is why so many of us wonder how our parents and grandparents seemed able to enjoy a higher standard of living even though their means were so much less than ours.<br> &nbsp;<br> The meritocracy that underpins our economy and culture&#x2014;work hard, move up the ladder&#x2014;has also been weakening, as the distribution of income has become increasingly uneven. In the 1950s and 1960s, our national economic growth trickled down across a broad spectrum of income levels. Since the 1970s it has been more fractured, with much of the economic gains benefiting upper-income households. This concentration of wealth leaves the middle class, the heart and soul of this country, struggling just to hang on.<br> &nbsp;<br> The epic financial crisis&#x2014;and there really is no other way to describe it&#x2014;that began in 2008 may have delivered a decisive blow to the stubborn optimism that we held on to in spite of the on-the-ground reality of how our financial lives have been marked by increasing struggle. For many, the crisis was a rude awakening; for others, it was a grim confirmation of the creeping anxiety we&#x2019;ve been feeling about how we are going to make it all work. Either way, it is hard to find a family that was untouched by this financial disaster. It was a galvanizing moment for us as a nation&#x2014;it has forced us to reckon with our beliefs in our country and our individual ideals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Is it time, then, to pronounce the American Dream dead?<br> &nbsp;<br> In many ways it pains me to say this, but in my opinion the American Dream as we knew it is dead.<br> &nbsp;<br> But listen to me: That is not such a bad thing. The old American Dream has been in need of revision for quite some time; we have just been very good at avoiding that truth. It&#x2019;s time to take that dream back into our hands and reshape it. It&#x2019;s time to create a New American Dream that is based in honesty, authenticity, good intentions, and genuine need.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is important to understand is that the American Dream is not something to put your faith in, to pray for, to embrace blindly, and hope that everything turns out okay&#x2014;despite its long, dependable run. Rather, it is a concept, a loose set of goals that beg for individualization. The American Dream was never one-size-fits-all. The New American Dream asks you to fashion a dream that suits you&#x2014;not one based on false premises and the expectations of others. It asks you to take measure of your own needs and understand what it will take to provide for yourself and those around you&#x2014;your family, your community, and those less fortunate.<br> &nbsp;<br> The truth is, we are on the threshold of an important moment. We can come together, right here, right now, and each one of us can envision our own New American Dream&#x2014;a dream that is rooted in reality, not superficiality; in truth and integrity, not illusion and falsehood.<br> &nbsp;<br> MAKING CHANGE<br> &nbsp;<br> I am a great believer in the power of perspective. Often when we find ourselves in a difficult situation we come to believe we have no options. We convince ourselves there is no way out. Despair and frustration take root and convince us that things are more desperate than they may actually be. When I&#x2019;ve found myself in those situations in my own life, I have learned that a change in perspective can change everything. What seemed insurmountable can be overcome. Not without difficulty, but through ingenuity and dedication. We can make a difference when we think differently. If you have any doubt about the truth of that statement, think of any significant achievement throughout American history, from our founding as a nation built on those inalienable rights and freedoms, to the civil rights movement.<br> &nbsp;<br> What we need first and foremost then, to erase the feelings of hopelessness and to ease our fears, is a change in perspective. Let us recognize what the American Dream no longer is, in order to give birth to a New American Dream.<br> &nbsp;<br> We must abandon any vestige of the old dream that suggested it was delivered on a silver platter as a matter of national birthright, and that our economy would forever be the rising tide that lifts all boats. The dream I am asking you to create&#x2014;this New American Dream&#x2014;is a very individualistic pursuit. It calls upon you to take stock of the challenges we face as a nation with an economy that is still struggling to recover from the effects of a crippling recession. And then it calls upon you to take stock of your own life, your own needs, your own security. We must transform ourselves from dreaming society&#x2019;s dreams and putting our faith in a false and misleading sense of entitlement, to being a society where each of us strives for dreams that are personal and realistic and that are in the best interests&#x2014;in the truest and most honest sense&#x2014;of us and our family. I am calling upon each of us to rethink the very way we dream.</p><h2>The Knitgrrl Guide to Professional Knitwear Design</h2><p>The Knitgrrl Guide To Professional Knitwear Design is the first-ever book targeted to designers of all experience levels who want to create, communicate and sell their work professionally to magazines, publishers, consumers and other markets.

He is a trial lawyer and a paraplegic &#x2013; two factors that don&#x2019;t contribute to longevity. So, that Saturday afternoon in December, when I walked into the family room and found Zack and our mastiff, Pantera, gazing at the ten-foot Nova Scotia fir we&#x2019;d chosen the day before, I felt a frisson of joy. Outside, the wind howled, the trees swayed and creaked, and the sky was dark with the threat of snow; inside, a fire burned low in the grate, the air was pungent with the sharpness of evergreen, and the man I loved was at peace with his dog beside him. It was over three weeks until Christmas, but our fourteen-year-old daughter, Taylor, had jump-started the season by hang ing her collection of crystal stars in the windows, where they sparkled, evoking memories of other Christmases, other lives. I placed my hands on Zack&#x2019;s shoulders and rested my chin on his head. &#x201c;&#x2018;The house and the hall were lit with happiness,&#x2019;&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;&#x2018;And lords and ladies were luminous with joy.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack covered my hands with his. &#x201c;Now that <i>is </i>beautiful,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. </i>I bought a copy last year and tucked it in with the Christmas decorations, thinking we could read it to the granddaughters when they&#x2019;re older.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re older,&#x201d; Zack said. &#x201c;We could read it now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d like it. A green knight with a green beard rides his green horse into King Arthur&#x2019;s court at Christmas. The green knight takes out his axe and offers it to whichever of Arthur&#x2019;s knights will cut off his head.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack turned his chair around to face me. &#x201c;The green knight wants somebody to cut off <i>his </i>head?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a catch. Whoever wields the axe must agree to be struck in return.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;By the guy whose head he just lopped off?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the challenge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack chortled. &#x201c;Blood in, blood out &#x2013; my kind of story.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;In that case, when we get back here after the concert, we&#x2019;ll warm up some soup, build a fire, and start reading.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack held out his arms. &#x201c;Who has more fun than us?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nobody,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Nobody has more fun than us.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It&#x2019;s not easy for a man in a wheelchair and an able-bodied woman to embrace, but Zack and I had had practice. When my husband ran his hand up my leg, he groaned with pleasure. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re wearing the black slip,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;God, I love this slip.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m wearing it because we have a party to go to. &#x2019;Tis the season, remember?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The Wainbergs&#x2019; party, then the choir thing,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Speaking of the choir thing,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I have something for you.&#x201d; I handed him a manila envelope. Zack opened it and grinned. &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s the photo that was in the paper.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It is indeed,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And having a copy made and enlarged cost more than it should have.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack put on his glasses and assessed the photo. &#x201c;Money well spent,&#x201d; he said, and he was right.<br>&nbsp;<br>Taylor&#x2019;s high school, Luther College, had been rehearsing its yearly Christmas choral concert, and she and her two best friends were in the junior handbell choir. The local paper&#x2019;s photographer had caught them in mid-ring. It was a seasonal photograph on a slow news day, and the layout person had given the picture pride of place on the front page.<br>&nbsp;<br>In their Luther sweatshirts, blue jeans, and spotless white cotton gloves, the girls were an appealing trio. Gracie Falconer, athletic, big-boned, red-haired and ruddily freckled, was beaming, transported, as she always was, by the sheer joy of action. Isobel Wainberg&#x2019;s springy black curls had escaped the silver headband with which she had tried to tame them, and her fine features were drawn in concentration. The standards Isobel set herself were high; she would not easily forgive herself a mistake in performance. Taylor&#x2019;s expression was rapturous. She was a girl who lived life more deeply than most &#x2013; her pleasures were more keenly experienced; her pains, sharper-edged. The photographer had captured Taylor at a moment when her private wellspring of joy overflowed, and it was a lovely sight.<br>&nbsp;<br>As Zack&#x2019;s eyes remained fixed on the photo, I marvelled at how completely he had metamorphosed into a family man in the two years we had been together. He was forty-eight when we met, and he&#x2019;d spent a lifetime travelling fast and light. There were two passions in his life: the law, and his legal partners, whom he&#x2019;d loved since they gravitated to one another midway through their first year of law school and committed themselves to share what they were certain would be a golden destiny. There had been many women in Zack&#x2019;s life, but few had been invited to stick around for breakfast.<br>&nbsp;<br>When we met, I was a widow with three grown children: Mieka, who was newly divorced, the mother of two young daughters, and the owner-operator of UpSlideDown, a caf�/ play centre for young families; Peter, who had just graduated from the School of Veterinary Medicine; and Angus, who was at the College of Law in Saskatoon. Taylor was the only one of my children still at home. When her mother, the artist Sally Love, who had been my friend since childhood, died suddenly, Taylor was four. There was no one to take Sally&#x2019;s daughter, so I adopted her. It was one of the best decisions I&#x2019;d ever made.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was content with my life and then Zack came along. As our relationship grew serious, everyone who cared for us felt compelled to wave a red flag. We ignored them. Six months to the day after we met, Zack and I stood at the altar of St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and exchanged vows. When I&#x2019;d leaned down to kiss my new husband, he&#x2019;d whispered, &#x201c;This is forever, Ms. Shreve. We made a promise, and a deal&#x2019;s a deal.&#x201d; Since that grey New Year&#x2019;s morning, we&#x2019;d never looked back. Ours was not an easy marriage, but it was a good one.<br>&nbsp;<br>As he propped the photo on the mantel, Zack&#x2019;s voice was wistful. &#x201c;Think we&#x2019;re looking at the next generation of partners at Falconer Shreve and Wainberg?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Gracie is planning to be a professional basketball player, so she&#x2019;s out, and we both know that Taylor wants to make art &#x2013; the way her mother did.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack frowned. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Taylor&#x2019;s mother, Joanne. Blood ties are significant, especially when the birth mother is someone as extraordinary as Sally Love, but Taylor&#x2019;s your daughter, our daughter, and we have the papers to prove it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Spoken like a lawyer,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Spoken like a lawyer who knows that in these cases smart people make themselves bulletproof, and we are bulletproof.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I felt my nerves twang. For a man who&#x2019;d spent forty-three years in a wheelchair because he&#x2019;d been in the wrong place at the wrong time, Zack was remarkably sanguine about the vagaries of fate. I needed to return to safe ground. I took the photo from the mantel. &#x201c;Isobel&#x2019;s your best hope. She&#x2019;s smart and focused &#x2013; &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And way, way, way too hard on herself,&#x201d; Zack finished. &#x201c;Izzy&#x2019;s just like her mother who, incidentally, is driving me crazy these days.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack extended his hands, palms up in a gesture of exasperation. &#x201c;Beats me. Delia never &#x2013; and I mean <i>never </i>&#x2013; makes mistakes, but lately she&#x2019;s made some doozies &#x2013; forgetting meetings, not returning phone calls, and last week she almost missed a critical filing deadline. Luckily, the associate she&#x2019;s working with picked up on it, but it was a close call, so I went to Dee&#x2019;s office and asked her what the hell was going on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did she have an explanation?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nope. She told me to back off and said that it wouldn&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I examined the jumbo box of Christmas-tree balls Zack had bought that morning to replace the ones Pantera had eaten the year before. They were all red &#x2013; Zack&#x2019;s favourite colour. &#x201c;Do you think Delia and Noah could be having problems?&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Apart from the fact that Noah worships Delia, and she treats him like a piece of furniture? It&#x2019;s been that way for twenty-seven years, and they&#x2019;re still together.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maybe Delia&#x2019;s met a man who&#x2019;s more than a piece of furniture to her.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Zack&#x2019;s snort was derisive. &#x201c;Nah &#x2013; Delia&#x2019;s not built that way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all built that way,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not Delia. The only thing that makes her heart pound is a real red-meat case. What would make you think she&#x2019;s having an affair?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t use the word &#x2018;affair,&#x2019; but something&#x2019;s disturbing her. A couple of days ago when we were waiting for the girls to get out of rehearsal, Delia got a phone call. I was sitting beside her so I couldn&#x2019;t avoid hearing her end of the conversation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What did she say?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not much &#x2013; just &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t I at least see you?

A recent study suggests that one in 250 Americans cannot tolerate gluten. Many suffer from Celiac disease, a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine and interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. Many others also suffer from food allergies that trigger a wheat or gluten sensitivity. Quite often, the only treatment is a gluten-free diet. </p><p> <b>The Best Gluten-Free Family Cookbook</b> features sensational recipes for baked goods, desserts, and main meals -- foods that are typically avoided in gluten-free diets.

They have extensive recipe development experience and are also the authors of <i>America's Best Bread Machine Baking Recipes</i>, <i>More of America's Best Bread Machine Baking Recipes</i> and <i>125 Best Quick Bread Recipes</i>. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><p> We are excited about this new gluten-free cookbook -- our second. Perhaps your family is already enjoying the recipes from our first gluten-free cookbook, <i>125 Best Gluten-Free Recipes</i>. We had lots of fun working together (and eating together) on this project, even planning each day's recipe development schedule around lunch. On a typical day, we put a cake in the oven early in the morning, then put a salad dressing in the fridge, mixed muffin batter and simmered soup so all were hot and ready to eat for lunch at one. Our lucky husbands didn't hesitate to share their opinions at dinner. </p><p> We continue to bake with sorghum and bean flours, as we are so pleased with the results. Your emails and letters tell us you are sharing the foods you prepare from our baking chapters with the rest of the family. You will notice that we have introduced several new nutritious flours and grains in this book, now that the products are more readily available at grocery and health food stores or through mail order or the web. Quinoa and amaranth -- both the grains and the flours -- and buckwheat flakes are products that will increase the variety and nutritional value of your diet. </p><p> Once again, although you may find a specific combination of flours and starches repeated in several recipes, we have not developed recipes around a 'flour mix,' but have developed each on its own to give us the taste and baking qualities we desired. This means you'll need to have a greater variety of flours available in your kitchen, and you'll have two or three more measurements to make, but you tell us it is worth it. We have included three mixes to save you time. The muffin mix has five variations, the cookie mix has six and the pancake mix has four. </p><p> We have met so many terrific people as we take our cookbook to celiac conferences and chapter meetings in both the U.S. and Canada. Thank you for sharing your successes, your recipes and your suggestions for recipes with us. We have adapted several, which are in the book: Macaroni and Cheese, an energy bar, an oil-based pastry and 'quick and easy' dinner ideas, just to mention a few. We look forward to meeting you as we travel to introduce this cookbook and share our knowledge and experience at your support group meetings. </p><p> Some of our recipes have been inspired by meals we had at restaurants or while traveling. These include a Sticky Date Pudding with Toffee Sauce just like the sticky toffee pudding Donna tasted in a small village in Wales, and a Chocolate Lover's Hazelnut Surprise even better than the volcano cake with a runny chocolate center we shared in a chain restaurant. We have kept up with the latest information on gluten-free ingredients, gluten-free food products and food trends, and we're delighted to pass these tips on to you, along with the easy-to-prepare recipes. </p><p> We have tested recipes together for more than ten years, and we still enjoy every bite. As professional home economists, we look at every food from nutritional, food safety and quality angles. We can assure you that every recipe has been tested and tested and tested in our test kitchen. We even researched and purchased new pans, another heavy-duty mixer and several modern kitchen tools, as ours have seen many decades of use and abuse. What a good excuse to re-equip our kitchens! </p><p> Celiac friends and focus group members have evaluated the tastes, textures and carrying properties of the baked goods and have prepared the foods to make sure the recipe instructions made sense. We've put the same amount of care and time into this cookbook as we have with our other cookbooks.

In <em>A Human Eye</em>, Rich examines a diverse selection of writings and their place in past and present social disorders and transformations. Beyond literary theories, she explores from many angles how the arts of language have acted on and been shaped by their creators&#x2019; worlds.This powerful new collection includes a stirring response to the anthology <em>Iraqi Poetry Today</em>, a critique of three classic socialist manifestos, and a rereading of <em>The Dead Lecturer</em>, an early volume of poems by LeRoi Jones. Rich engages the impulse to make art that both impels toward and interacts with social change, a theme she also traces through the letters of poets Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, gay and lesbian politics and poetry, and influential texts on Zionism and the Jewish diaspora.</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.Humanitarian poet Rich is a live-wire essayist, taking measure here of what she describes as a &#x201c;permeable membrane between art and society.&#x201d; The title of her latest collection is from Karl Marx: &#x201c;The eye has become a human eye only when its object&nbsp;has become a human, social object.&#x201d; And it is this human connection and vision that Rich searches for in the literature she discusses. Strong writing, Rich believes, is about &#x201c;how we are with each other,&#x201d;&nbsp;and she finds this encompassing theme in the work of Muriel Rukeyser, whom Rich admires for her &#x201c;poetics of historical sensibility&#x201d;; James Baldwin, who was &#x201c;uncanny&#x201d; in his prescience; and June Jordan, who believed humor and pleasure are essential to social change. Rich deep-reads poetry written in the shadow of AIDS and during tyranny and war in Iraq, and argues that we must all be &#x201c;resistant to dogma.&#x201d; For all Rich&#x2019;s shepherding us toward compassion and solidarity with those who suffer violence and injustice, she never ceases to praise the mystery intrinsic to poetry and art. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Life Before Man</h2><p>In an outstanding sequence of illustrations, Life Before Man reconstructs in vivid detail the conditions on our planet from its earliest beginnings more than 3000 million years ago to the arrival of Homo sapiens.

But now Caesar is the dominant figure and Cicero&#x2019;s life is in ruins. </p> <p>Exiled, separated from his wife and children, his possessions confiscated, his life constantly in danger, Cicero is tormented by the knowledge that he has sacrificed power for the sake of his principles. </p> <p>His comeback requires wit, skill and courage &#x2013; and for a brief and glorious period, the legendary orator is once more the supreme senator in Rome. </p> <p>But politics is never static and no statesman, however cunning, can safeguard against the ambition and corruption of others. </p> <p>Riveting and tumultuous, DICTATOR encompasses some of the most epic events in human history yet is also an intimate portrait of a brilliant, flawed, frequently fearful yet ultimately brave man &#x2013; a hero for his time and for ours. This is an unforgettable tour de force from a master storyteller.</p></p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <i>An Officer and a Spy, Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, Lustrum</i>, and <i>The Ghost</i>, all of which were international bestsellers. His work has been translated into thirty-seven languages. After graduating with a degree in English from Cambridge University, he worked as a reporter for the BBC's Panorama and Newsnight programmes, before becoming political editor of the <i>Observer</i> and subsequently a columnist on the <i>Sunday Times </i>and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He is married to Gill Hornby and they live with their four children in a village near Hungerford.I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon. Of all the men I ever knew, Cicero was the least equipped by temperament for exile. To thrive he needed the appurtenances of civilised society&#x2014;friends, news...</p><h2>Escape!: A Story of the Underground Railroad</h2><p>While on a visit to the Anacostia Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, Emma finds herself as a runaway slave using the Underground Railroad to make her way to freedom in Canada.</p><p>Sharon Shavers Gayle is an African-American writer and children&#39;s book editor.

In this entertaining book, be tells the story of his extraordinary life in baseball and offers provocative insights into the game&#39;s past, present, and future. The box score? The most complete player of his time has given us the complete baseball book, from the grit of the infield dirt on his spikes as he turned a double play against a charging Frank Robinson to no-holds-barred banter in the locker room with Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, and Pete Rose, from the frustration of seeing good teams destroyed by racism and incompetence to the triumph of winning it all with the most talented, and the smartest, team in baseball, Cincinnati&#39;s Big Red Machine. In vivid anecdotes, Joe Morgan recounts starting out in the minor leagues in the still-segregated South, the only black player on the Durham Bulls; earning a trip to the majors with the expansion Colt 45s (soon to become the Houston Astros), a rag tag collection of over-the-hill veterans and inexperienced youngsters with its own band of outlaws, &#34;The Dalton Gang&#34;; honing his game with the help of all-time-great Nellie Fox; competing against the likes of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver, Reggie Jackson, Willie McCovey, and Willie Stargell; winning back to back MVP awards and World Series; dramatic seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland A&#39;s; and being welcomed into the Hall of Fame by his childhood idol, Ted Williams. At the heart of the book is the tale of how four big, combative egos - Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, Pete Rose, and Morgan himself - learned to win together under Sparky Anderson&#39;s leadership, transforming the Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine, the most successful team of the 1970s. Joe Morgan shows us how the Reds dominated games with sheer baseball smarts as well as awesome physical skill, and he gives us up-close views of his teammates, including Sparky Anderson&#39;s gift for molding individuals into a team dedicated to winning, Johnny Bench&#39;s flair for the dramatic play, Tony Perez&#39;s unquenchable will-to-win in the clutch, and Pete Rose&#39;s tumultuous experiences on and off the field. It&#39;s all here, from the day Dave Concepcion took a ride in the locker room dryer to George Foster&#39;s reply to an accusation of cheating: &#34;I don&#39;t cork my bat. I cork my arm.&#34; Bringing his unparalleled feel for winning baseball right up to the present, Morgan also gives us hard-hitting commentary on the current state of the game, discussing why today&#39;s teams play brain dead, what keeps Rickey Henderson and other stars from being as great as they think they are, why good teams self-destruct so easily, why the new commissioner will find it hard to act &#34;in the best interests of baseball,&#34; and how baseball ought to deal with such issues as expansion, free agency, and minority hiring. His controversial prescription for baseball&#39;s future - the appointment of a baseball ambassador empowered to negotiate with both players and owners for the good of the game - will spark lively debate all through the season and beyond. The final tally: here is a baseball read with the spark that made Joe Morgan the winningest player of his time.</p><h2>Louise Bourgeois</h2><p>Provides color plates of Bourgeois&#39; sculptures and installations, essays, an interview, critical analysis, and Louise Bourgeois&#39; writings on her art.</p><p>Robert Storr is Rosalie Solow Professor of Modern Art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. Formerly Senior Curator at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2004 he curated the 5th SITE Sante Fe Biennial in New Mexico. Storr was a contributing author to Phaidon&#39;s Raymond Pettibon (2003), Alex Katz (2006) and Robert Mangold (2000). Paulo Herkenhoff is an independent curator and critic based in Rio de Janeiro. Formerly adjunct Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Herkenhoff was Artistic Director of the 24th Bienal de Sao Paulo (1999) and Curator of the Brazilian Pavilion of the 47th Venice Biennale (1997). Allan Schwartzman is an independent art critic who often contributes to The New York Times as well as many other journals and newspapers. Schwartzman is a longtime follower of Bourgeois&#39; work.This elegant volume is the second book about Bourgeois to appear in recent months, evidence of a surge of interest that Bernadac succinctly describes as "inversely proportional to the neglect" Bourgeois suffered for decades. Bernadac, former curator of the Musee Picasso, offers convincing explanations both for the art world's persistent blindness to Bourgeois' startlingly original, sensual, and challenging sculpture and for the sudden recognition of its power, integrity, and courageous beauty. Bernadac successfully combines biography with criticism throughout this chronological overview, enriching the experience of viewing Bourgeois' art, from her highly symbolic works on paper to her newest work, the "cells," mysterious and dramatic large-scale installations. These daring works have occupied the indefatigable Bourgeois since she entered her eighties five years ago. Fiercely independent, adept at creating provocative abstractions out of myriad materials, Bourgeois is "unclassifiable" and profoundly compelling, qualities attributable, Bernadac believes, to Bourgeois' perception of art as fetishistic. For Bourgeois, the making of art is a magical and curative act, deeply emotional and erotic, thus resoundingly universal. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The Second Common Reader</h2><p>Here, in twenty-six essays, Woolf writes of English literature in its various forms, including the poetry of Donne; the novels of Defoe, Sterne, Meredith, and Hardy; Lord Chesterfield&#x2019;s letters and De Quincey&#x2019;s autobiography.

How we understand authority determines how we deal with the claims of the tradition on us; how we deal with those claims determines how we shape our own Judaism. That conclusion opens the gate to a reconsideration of all of Judaism's theology, in particular how we understand God, for God is at the heart of Torah."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>With clarity and passion, award-winning teacher, author and theologian Neil Gillman captures the power of Jewish theological claims and reveals extraordinary insights into Jewish identity, the purpose of religion, and our relationship with God.</p><p>Drawing from Judaism's sacred texts as well as great thinkers such as Mordecai Kaplan, Abraham Joshua Heschel and Paul Tillich, Gillman traces his theological journey over four decades of study, beginning with his own understanding of revelation. He explores the role of symbol and myth in our understanding of the nature of God and covenant. He examines the importance of community in both determining authority and sanctifying sacred space.</p><p>By charting the development of his own personal theology, Gillman explores the evolution of Jewish thought and its implications for modern Jewish religious identity today and in the future.</p></p><p><p><strong>Neil Gillman</strong>, rabbi and PhD, is professor of Jewish philosophy at The Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he has served as chair of the Department of Jewish Philosophy and dean of the Rabbinical School.

The first section contains a wonderful article on prophecy in the works of Heschel, and another on renewed interest in resurrection over the past half-century. In the second section Gilman discusses the role of the Jewish philosopher; this portion also includes an analysis of rabbinic education written in 1990.

If natural selection applies, how did the evolutionary process give rise to minds capable of profound insights into mathematics, the structure of matter and the nature of life itself?

In this book Max Delbrck calls upon his unusual career in physics and later in biology to analyse these fundamental questions. He traces organic evolution from bacteria to man, and explains how biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology have done so much to advance our understanding of that process.

Little Balser lives with his parents, a younger brother, and a baby sister in a cozy log cabin on the bank of the Big Blue River. Although only thirteen or fourteen years old, he is quite familiar with the dangers and rigors of frontier life. As the story unfolds, the boy becomes lost in the forest, encounters the fierce one-eared bear, and is nearly caught by a bear as he dozes next to what he thinks is a bearskin. This is a book for children or adults who love nature and tales of early pioneer life.</p><p>Away back in the &#39;twenties&#39;, when Indiana was a baby state, and great forests of tall trees and tangled underbrush darkened what are now her bright plains and sunny hills, there stood upon the east bank of Big Blue River, a mile or two north of the point where that stream crosses the Michigan road, a cozy log cabin of two rooms-one front and one back.Charles Major (1856-1913) was an American lawyer and novelist. Born to an upper-middle class Indianapolis family, Major developed in interest in both law and English history at an early age and attended the University of Michigan from 1872 through 1875, being admitted to the Indiana bar association in 1877. Shortly thereafter he opened his own law practice, which launched a short political career, culminating in a year-long term in the Indiana state legislature. Writing remained an interest of Major, and in 1898, he published his first novel, When Knighthood Was in Flower. The novel about England during the reign of King Henry VIII was an exhaustively researched historical romance, and became enormously popular, holding a place on the New York Times bestselling list for nearly three years. Major continued to write and publish several additional novels, to varying degrees of success, as well as a number of children&#39;s adventure stories, most set in and around his native state of Indiana.</p><h2>A Treasury of Christmas Songs and Carols [Arranged for piano, voice and guitar]</h2><p>Compiles carols, hymns, chorales, solo songs, and canons for Christmas from many lands</p><p></p><h2>Dispelling the Tyranny (Struggle for Freedom Series 2)</h2><p>After fleeing to Germany with his parents in 1568 because of the persecution of Dutch Protestants, Marteen Meulenberg joins the army of Count Lodewyk in his fight to defeat the Spanish forces that control his homeland.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Dutch</p><h2>The Many</h2><p>Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2016 Observer Best Fiction of 2016 Den of Geek Top Books of 2016 Timothy Buchannan buys an abandoned house on the edge of an isolated village on the coast, sight unseen. When he sees the state of it he questions the wisdom of his move, but starts to renovate the house for his wife, Lauren to join him there. When the villagers see smoke rising from the chimney of the neglected house they are disturbed and intrigued by the presence of the incomer, intrigue that begins to verge on obsession. And the longer Timothy stays, the more deeply he becomes entangled in the unsettling experience of life in the small village. Ethan, a fisherman, is particularly perturbed by Timothy&#39;s arrival, but accedes to Timothy&#39;s request to take him out to sea. They set out along the polluted coastline, hauling in weird fish from the contaminated sea, catches that are bought in whole and removed from the village. Timothy starts to ask questions about the previous resident of his house, Perran, questions to which he receives only oblique answers and increasing hostility. As Timothy forges on despite the villagers&#39; animosity and the code of silence around Perran, he starts to question what has brought him to this place and is forced to confront a painful truth. The Many is an unsettling tale that explores the impact of loss and the devastation that hits when the foundations on which we rely are swept away.</p><p>Wyl Menmuir was born in 1979 in Stockport. He lives on the north coast of Cornwall with his wife and two children and works as a freelance editor and literacy consultant. The Many is his first novel.An intriguing, evocative and formally ambitious debut. -- Luke Brown * Financial Times * If it is possible to describe a book as being rich on spare detail then The Many is it, like a stock reduced to its very essence, and I suspect it was this lack of extraneous waffle and digression in the company of Wyl Menmuir&#39;s beguiling writing style that grabbed my attention and kept me wedded to this novel in the days immediately after Port Eliot festival. * Dovegreyreader * He deserves 10 out of 10 when it comes to the creation of atmosphere, and Menmuir can certainly write... A writer to watch. * The Independent * Paperback of the Week It would be wrong to give away the precise reasons for his protagonist&#39;s state, but as Menmuir&#39;s allegory becomes decipherable, it is increasingly affecting, and the moment when we understand how the bay and its darkly looming ships might be the warped echo of an earlier, shattering scene is one of great power. -- Stephanie Cross * The Observer * A parable on ecological destruction, a commentary on monotony and parochialness, an obscure examination of sorrow, an investigation into the mysterious workings of the psyche - The Many is weird and disorienting, yes, but original and wonderful too. * On Art and Aesthetics * I found myself totally gripped. The kind of book where you end it still wanting answers and yet are unsure of the questions. It&#39;s a wonderful book and the first book I&#39;ve finished this year that I immediately wanted to read again. * Information Overlord * This is a novel that has to be read at one go but one of those rare stories that once you have reached the end you start reading it all over again. There are moments one has to pause and wonder if it is reminiscent of similar writing in the past and then realise it would be unfair to compare The Many to any other writing. Wyl Menmuir&#39;s style is wholly original, it grips one with its exquisitely chiselled style to create a stunningly beautiful and memorable novel much like the Cornish coast is. -- Jaya Bhattacharji Rose * Confessions of an avid bibliophile * an intriguing first novel -- Fiona Wilson * The Times * It creates an effective sense of tension and psychological suspense along the lines of Henry James&#39; The Turn of the Screw but passages where the men are out fishing in the gloom also invoke a feelings of intense meditation and a primal self-sufficiency similar to Hemingway&#39;s The Old Man and the Sea. I was slowly drawn into the novel&#39;s bizarre climate of secrecy and impending doom. The Many is a brisk, impactful novel which poignantly portrays grief, solitude and an inhibited state of consciousness. * Lonesome Reader * At about the two-thirds point, I started to realize that I was not reading a conventional, if slightly off-kilter and moody, story about a man having a hard time getting his life back together in a semi-hostile village. No, The Many is a horrific, beautifully horrific, tale that I cannot shake, as much as I may like to. * The Mookse and the Gripes * Menmuir&#39;s homespun horror has flashes of Daphne du Maurier&#39;s ghost-gothic and John Wyndham&#39;s dystopia while displaying its own individuality and flair ... Menmuir steers a steady course; the result is profound and discomfiting, and deserving of multiple readings. -- Catherine Taylor * The Guardian * This book is powerfully written and haunting. Always teetering on the edge of the gothic, Menmuir describes a coastal community that is dreamlike, slightly out of focus, with its own rules that Timothy never grasps. At the same time, it is rooted in the real world: remote bureaucracy, plummeting fish stocks and maritime pollution have blighted the lives of the fishermen. * Blue Book Balloon * The sparse prose is dark and intense, strikingly written with a haunting quality that sends shivers through the soul. * neverimitate * Though it was perhaps not written with this in mind, reading the novel during the nightmarish toxicity of the EU Referendum gives it an interesting prescience in its exploration of a failing, unwelcoming community&#39;s reaction to an outsider, the decaying environment that surrounds them both and the looming warnings of a distant bureaucracy. That fishing quotas, ecology and environmental regulations are also part of the ongoing debate feeds into that sense of a discussion in microcosm. The sense of loss that permeates here is not just related to the personal, but to the social and communal as well. * Film and Other Assorted Buffery * The Many unfolds like an unsettling dream, shifting illogically, asking the reader to accept leaps from reality to what seems like it may be fantasy (or may be a matter of perception). But it&#39;s not just a strange fable, there is humanity in it too: Ethan&#39;s palpable grief for Perran; the locals&#39; struggle to adapt to a world in which their former livelihoods have become obsolete; the touches of tenderness in Timothy and Lauren&#39;s scenes together. Its portrayal of a community left behind by technology and bureaucracy, suspicious of the threat represented by &#39;outsiders&#39;, is recognisable and timely - perhaps even more so now than the author may have intended. * Learn This Phrase *</p><h2>Golden Album Quilt: 20 Patchwork Patterns</h2><p>With techniques for everything from piecing simple squares to sewing compass points, this quilter&#39;s guide leads novice stitchers through piecing diagrams, fabric guides, and full-sized block templates.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>When war broke out in August 1914, 21-year-old Vera Brittain was planning on enrolling at Somerville College, Oxford. Her father told her she wouldn't be able to go: "In a few months' time we should probably all find ourselves in the Workhouse!" he opined. Brittain had hoped to escape the Northern provinces, but the war seemingly dashed her plans. "It is not, perhaps, so very surprising that the War at first seemed to me an infuriating personal interruption rather than a world-wide catastrophe." <p> Her father eventually relented, however, and she was allowed to attend. By the end of her first year, she had fallen in love with a young soldier and resolved to become active in the war effort by volunteering as a nurse--turning her back on what she called her "provincial young-ladyhood." Brittain suffered through 12-hour days by reminding herself that nothing she endured was worse than what her fianc�, Roland, experienced in the trenches. Roland was expected home on leave for Christmas 1915; on December 26, Brittain received news that he had been killed at the front. Ten months later Brittain herself was sent to Malta and then to France to serve in the hospitals nearer the front, where she witnessed firsthand the horrors of battle. When peace finally came, Brittain had also lost her brother Edward and two close friends. As she walked the streets of London on November 11, 1918--Armistice Day--she felt alone in the crowds:</p><p> </p><blockquote> For the first time I realised, with all that full realisation meant, how completely everything that had hitherto made up my life had vanished with Edward and Roland, with Victor and Geoffrey. The War was over; a new age was beginning; but the dead were dead and would never return. </blockquote><p> First published in 1933, <i>Testament of Youth</i> established Brittain as one of the best-loved authors of her time. Her crisp, clear prose and searing honesty make this unsentimental memoir of a generation scarred by war a classic. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Vera Brittain (1893-1970) grew up in the north of England.

Shortly after the end of the Second World War, as the Soviets took control of the eastern part of Germany, Hanna, a schoolteacher&#39;s daughter, escaped with nothing more than a small suitcase and the clothes on her back. As Hanna built a new life in the West, her relatives (her mother, father and eight siblings) remained in the East. The construction of the Berlin Wall severed all hope of any future reunion. Hanna fell in love and moved to America. She made many attempts to establish contact with her family, but most were unsuccessful. Her father was under close observation; her mother, younger sister Heidi and the others struggled to adjust to life under a bizarre and brutal regime that kept its citizens cut off from the outside world. A few years later, Hanna had a daughter - Nina - who grew up to become the first female US Army intelligence officer to lead sensitive intelligence collection operations in East Berlin at the height of the Cold War. At the same time, Heidi&#39;s daughter, Cordula, was training to become a member of the East German Olympic cycling team. Though separated by only a few miles, Nina and her relatives led entirely different lives. Once the Berlin Wall came down, and the families were reunited, Nina Willner discovered an extraordinary story. In Forty Autumns she vividly brings to life many accounts of courage and survival, set against the backdrop of four decades that divided a nation and the world.</p><p><p>Growing up in a provincial village outside of Berlin, Hanna was encouraged by her schoolteacher father to follow her dreams. But at the end of World War II, the Soviets took control of the eastern part of Germany and established a repressive communist state&#x2014;East Germany&#x2014;which used brutal force and a massive wall to cut off East from West.</p><p>Determined to live free, Hanna made a dangerous escape to West Germany. But the price of freedom&#x2014;leaving behind her parents, her eight siblings, and her home&#x2014;was heartbreaking. Uprooted, Hanna eventually moved to America, where she settled down with her husband, a U.S. Army officer, and had children of her own, but she never forgot her parents and siblings trapped on the other side of the Berlin Wall.</p><p>Growing up near Washington, D.C., Hanna&#x2019;s daughter, Nina Willner, became the first female U.S. Army intelligence officer to lead sensitive intelligence collection operations in East Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Though separated by only a few miles, American Nina and her German relatives were kept apart, leaving a family divided for more than four decades by a bitter political war.</p><p>Nina takes us deep into the tumultuous and terrifying world of East Germany under communist rule, revealing both the harsh reality her relatives endured and her experiences as an intelligence officer running secret operations behind the Berlin Wall that put her life at risk.</p>Nina Willner is a former US Army intelligence officer who served in Berlin during the Cold War. Following a career in intelligence, Nina worked in Moscow, Minsk and Prague promoting human rights, children&#39;s causes and the rule of law for the US Government, non-profit organizations and a variety of charities. She currently lives in Istanbul, Turkey. Forty Autumns is her first book.</p><h2>The Z Was Zapped</h2><p>A dramatic black- and- white presentation of the alphabet in which the three-time Caldecott medalist depicts a mysterious transformation of each letter.</p><p>Chris Van Allsburg is the winner of two Caldecott Medals, for Jumanji and The Polar Express, as well as the recipient of a Caldecott Honor Book for The Garden of Abdul Gasazi. The author and illustrator of numerous picture books for children, he has also been awarded the Regina Medal for lifetime achievement in children&#x2019;s literature. In 1982, Jumanji won the National Book Award and in 1996, it was made into a popular feature film. Chris Van Allsburg was formerly an instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design. He lives in Rhode Island with his wife and two children.Van Allsburg's latest is not an alphabet book but an "alphabet theatre": as its title page proclaims, it is "a play in twenty-six acts, performed by the Caslon Players, written and directed by Mr. Chris Van Allsburg." In it, each letter of the alphabet is shown on a draped curtained stage, undergoing some sort of (usually ominous) transformation. Turning the page reveals the text that spells out the alphabetical event: the A was in an avalanche; the B was badly bitter; the C was cut to ribbons; and so on. This is an original and unusual undertaking, executed with both visual and verbal adroitness. In technique it most resembles Van Allsburg's The Mysteries of Harris Burdick; in both books, black pencil is used with remarkable skill to create the richness of texture and shading usually associated with full color. It is perhaps closest to Harris Burdick in ambition as well, in the sense that an imaginative challenge is presented to the reader (here, to come up with a verbal account of the pictured transformation before turning the page to find it). But the imaginative possibilities of the "alphabet theatre" are limited; this alphabet book format is more of an intriguing design element than a way to teach the ABCs. The picture and text that belong to a single letter are not on facing pages. While Van Allsburg's visual ingenuity is in full evidence (among his hauntingly realistic images are the evaporating E and the jittery J), there is both a sinister quality and an stagey dimension to the work. Artistically, a virtuoso performance, but one with an undeniably cold cast.

Vampire Blood trilogy comprising: Cirque Du Freak, The Vampire&#39;s Assistant and Tunnels of Blood. Join Darren Shan&#39;s descent into the darkness. CIRQUE DU FREAK Darren goes to a banned freak show with his best mate Steve. It&#39;s the wonderfully gothic Cirque Du Freak where weird, frightening half human/half animals appear who interact terrifyingly with the audience. After he sees the amazing performing spider, Madam Octa, Darren is determined to steal her. But his daring theft goes horribly wrong. The spider bites Steve and Darren has to sell his soul to an evil vampire to get the antidote. THE VAMPIRE&#39;S ASSISTANT Darren joins the vampire, Mr Crepsley, as his assistant and they return to the Cirque Du Freak. There, Darren makes friends with the snake-boy, Evra Von (who knows what Darren is) and a local boy, Sam, and RV, an eco-warrior and animal lover (who do not). Darren begins to enjoy his life among the Cirque performers as the youngest half-vampire in existence, but he defiantly refuses to drink human blood -- the whole idea sickens him -- and he tries desperately to cling on to the part of him which is human. TUNNELS OF BLOOD When Mr Crepsley is called upon by the Vampire Generals, Darren and the snake-boy, Evra Von, leave the Cirque Du Freak and travel with him to the city.

The sun had been shining brightly all day, and a gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the trees in town.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hi there, kids!&#x201d; someone called out to Jerry and Maya as they bicycled down the street.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the police chief, who was standing in front of a little newspaper stand enjoying an ice-cream cone. Jerry and Maya pedaled over to him. The police chief was an old acquaintance, and it was always good to talk to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a fantastic day,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Perfect ice-cream weather, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Absolutely,&#x201d; replied Jerry. &#x201c;Maya and I are on our way to the beach for a swim.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Lucky things,&#x201d; the police chief said with a laugh. &#x201c;We poor police officers have to keep our noses to the grindstone day in and day out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry and Maya looked at each other and winked. The police chief didn&#x2019;t exactly seem overwhelmed with work.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you been busy at the station?&#x201d; asked Maya, curious all the same. The two friends ran a small detective agency together, and Maya was always on the lookout for an exciting new case.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I shouldn&#x2019;t really tell you this,&#x201d; said the police chief. &#x201c;But you have helped me before, and I&#x2019;m sure you can keep a secret, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry and Maya nodded eagerly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief leaned forward and lowered his voice to a whisper. &#x201c;Pickpockets! At the circus outside town! Several people were robbed at the first performance yesterday. I&#x2019;ve called the police stations in the other towns where the circus has performed, and it&#x2019;s always the same thing: Cell phones, necklaces, and wallets disappear after each show.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief nodded thoughtfully and continued, &#x201c;But as soon as the circus leaves town, the thefts stop, too. It seems as if the thief is part of the circus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief leaned in even closer, and Jerry saw that the scoop of melting ice cream was about to plop right out of the waffle cone in the chief&#x2019;s hand. The police chief narrowed his eyes and whispered: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to the circus to check it out&#x2014;in plain clothes, of course. It takes a trained eye like mine to spot a skilled pickpocket. I&#x2019;m going to both shows this evening: the one at 6:00 p.m. and the one at 8:00 p.m.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> With a splat, the chief&#x2019;s ice cream fell out of the cone and landed on the sidewalk. The police chief frowned at the sticky puddle at his feet, but before he could react, his cell phone rang.<br> &nbsp;<br> The police chief answered it in a serious voice: &#x201c;Hello. Police chief of Pleasant Valley speaking.&#x201d; Then he covered it with his hand and whispered to Jerry and Maya:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What a coincidence! It&#x2019;s the ringmaster.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry and Maya didn&#x2019;t want to interfere with official police business, so they waved good-bye and cycled on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just a block away at Market Square, Maya surprised Jerry by suddenly turning right instead of left.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wrong direction, Maya! The beach is this way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Forget the swim, Jerry! We have a job to do!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Of course!</i> Jerry understood exactly where Maya was heading: to the circus!<br> &nbsp;<br> The Whodunit Detective Agency had a new case to solve.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2: An Angry Woman</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Jerry and Maya rode their bikes to the grassy field at the base of the big sledding hill where the kids of Pleasant Valley played in the winter.<br> &nbsp;<br> At this time of year, there weren&#x2019;t any sleds to be seen. Instead, half a dozen circus tents had been pitched in an enormous circle, and in the very center stood a gigantic striped tent. Jerry and Maya hopped off their bicycles and walked toward the tents.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to the striped circus tents there were several colorful trailers, all marked <b>CIRCUS SPLENDIDO </b>in big red letters. The first trailer was the ticket booth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jerry and Maya knocked on the ticket-booth window, but there was nobody there.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably too early,&#x201d; said Maya. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s still an hour until the first show starts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That gives us plenty of time to investigate,&#x201d; said Jerry as he turned and walked toward another trailer.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,&#x201d; said Maya uncertainly, looking around.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she shrugged her shoulders and followed Jerry, who had already crept in between two of the circus trailers. There was a <b>RINGMASTER</b> sign on the door of one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was nice and cool in the shade of the tall trailers. The window on one end of the ringmaster&#x2019;s trailer was open, and Jerry and Maya jumped when they heard a woman shout from inside, &#x201c;I should have married Bobo instead of you, you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you washed-up failure of a ringmaster!

You have a magician who learned his tricks in prison and a strong man who breaks the audience&#x2019;s noses, and Bobo the clown seems to have more money than you.

How can the rain-starved crop produce enough rice to feed them, much less pay the rent? Perhaps the recently arrived young strangers from the city are right about the need for centuries-old traditions to change. At least when she listens to their talk, she feels the stirrings of hope...</p><p>Hesitantly, Jinga grows to trust the outsiders. There is Sri, who brings with her life-saving medicines and knowledge of how to use them. And there is Ned, who talks of taking charge of one's own destiny, and fighting those who would stand in the way. It is almost too late when Jinda realizes that her trust is misplaced -- that to Sri and Ned their cause is more important than the lives it would affect. Against a vividly evoked backdrop of rural and urban Thailand, Jinda heroically faces the challenges of holding on to who she is as the world around her revolves in what seems to be never-ending change.</p></p><p>In Her Own Words...<p></p><p>"I grew up on the outskirts of Bangkok, Thailand. Home was an airy house next to a fishpond and a big garden, with rice fields, where water buffalo wallowed in mudholes, on the other side of the palm trees. I liked the usual things--eating roasted coconuts and fried bananas, chasing catfish in the grass in the rain.</p><p>"Although I write in English, my first language was Chinese. Because my parents are from China, they praised me, scolded me, told me long bedtime stories, and recited poetry to me all in Chinese. No wonder, then, that I think of Chinese as the language of my heart. As I grew older, I absorbed Thai from interacting with people in the busy streets and marketplaces and temple fairs of Bangkok. Thai for me is a functional language, and I think of it as the language of my hands. Only much later did I team English from strict teachers in school, and so I think of English as the language of my head.</p><p>"I started to write only after I left home, as a way to conjure up Thailand for myself, to combat homesickness white Studying at Cornell University. There was a greenhouse on campus with a single potted banana tree in it. During my first winter, I used to sit near that tree and imagine that I was home. Soon, however, I realized that words could evoke images of home even more effectively than the banana tree, and I began to write down notes about the things I missed. My first book, Sing to the Dawn (1975), grew naturally out of those notes.</p><p>"I met my husband, John Dennis, at an antiwar demonstration while we were both students at Cornett. In 1976, six years and more than three hundred letters later, we were married. It took a Catholic church wedding and a Chinese tea ceremony (both in Singapore) and a Buddhist wrist-binding ritual (in a Thai village) to satisfy our families and friends.</p><p>"I am lucky that John has learned fluent Thai and some Chinese, and that his work often takes us to Asia. Our three children--Danfung, Mei-Mei, and Chris-have had a chance to live in Thailand, Laos, and Singapore, so they have experienced many of the sounds and sights that I did as a child. Like me, and I hope like many children today, they are growing up comfortable with a blend of several cultures and languages."</p>Seventeen-year-old Jinda's life is irrevocably changed when Ned and three other students from Bangkok visit her village. Inthorn, Jinda's father and the village headman, listens to Ned and resists paying the usurious land rents. Inthorn is jailed and eventually dies in prison; Jinda journeys to Bangkok to take part in student rallies for the farmers. Love interest is provided by the growing mutual infatuation of Ned and Jinda, sensitively and realistically handled. The main characters are especially well-drawn, although the others are stereotypes or, at worst, mere ciphers--the mother of one of the students is particularly offensive. A tad too predictable and polemically quite heavyhanded, Ho's novel nonetheless gives an interesting and at times absorbing glimpse of class struggle in the Thailand of the 1970s. Village scenes are especially effective evocations of simple beauty and somnolence. Not a masterpiece, but a novel from an author to watch. --John Philbrook, San Francisco Public Library<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa (Studies in the History of Christian Missions)</h2><p>David Livingstone's visit to Cambridge in 1857 was seen as much as a scientific event as a religious one. But he was by no means alone among missionaries in integrating mission with science and other fields of research. Rather, many missionaries were remarkable, pioneering polymaths.<br><br>This collection of essays explores the ways in which late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century missionaries to Africa contributed to various academic disciplines, such as linguistics, ethnography, social anthropology, zoology, medicine, and many more.

Now, with <i>The Three Golden Keys</i>, he gives us his most heartfelt and autobiographical work to date: the reworking of three classic Czechoslovakian fairy tales into a haunting illustrated fable of his lost childhood in Prague that is also a deeply felt allegory of the reclamation of a Czech cultural identity after forty-five years of Communist rule. A man returns to his home in the ancient city of his childhood. Three large rusty locks bar his entry. He knows he must somehow find the three golden keys that will let him in. Suddenly a black cat leaps off the gate; seeming to invite him to follow. Together they search through Prague's monuments and landmarks. With each key they find, a different aspect of the city comes to life and recounts for them a classic Czech fairy tale. The man runs back to his childhood home and excitedly opens the three rusty locks. Inside the front door, back turned to him, is his mother. She glances up, and as she recognizes him and comes to life, so does the city. Utterly magical on every level, <i>The Three Golden Keys</i> is destined to become a classic of children's literature. It truly is a "book for children of all ages."</p><p>Peter Sis was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, and studied painting and filmmaking at the Academy of Applied Arts in Prague, and at the Royal College of Art in London. He has written and illustrated many award-winning books for children, including the Caldecott Honor-winning <i>Starry Messenger: Galileo Galilei </i>and <i>Tibet Through the Red Box</i>. He lives in Paris, France and New York City.<br>Grade 2-4-When a storm blows a man's hot-air balloon off-course, he lands in a city where everything recalls his childhood in Prague. He finds the family house but it is locked with three rusty padlocks. He follows the family cat through the empty streets to the library, the Emperor's garden, and the famous town-square clock. In each place, figures from the past emerge from the walls and unroll a scroll that holds a key and relates the traditional Czech legends of Prince Bruncvik and his magic sword, the Golem, and Hanus the clockmaker. With the three keys in hand, he returns home where he recollects voices, sounds, and pictures. From the foreword to his daughter to the first-person voice, Sis has created a personal journey that is multilayered with images, memories, and symbols. The art itself is layered with felines, faces, and ghostly figures imposed over backgrounds, camouflaged in streets and structures, and emerging from misty reflections. With tiny, delicate lines and meshlike textures, the artist's distinctive style is evocative. The scroll stories are handscripted in numbered sequences with a pictogram bordering the two-page spreads. The tiny handwriting is so intricate it requires close focus. Overall the book is intriguing, with visual and textual subtleties interconnecting with cultural and historical ties. Older picture book readers should appreciate the beauty of the illustrations and the symbolism.<br><i>Julie Cummins, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Good Hands: 100 Letters And Talks of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M.

One night he lay down in the wilderness to sleep and had one of the great mystical experiences of Western religion. He dreamed there was a ladder, with angels ascending and descending, stretched between heaven and earth. For thousands of years, people have tried to overhear what the messengers came down to tell Jacob, and us. </p> <p>Now in a daring blend of scholarship and imagination, psychology and history, Lawrence Kushner gathers an inspiring range of interpretations of Genesis 28:16 given by sages, from Shmuel bar Nachmani in third-century Palestine to Hannah Rachel Werbermacher of Ludomir who lived in Poland two hundred years ago. Through a fascinating new literary genre and Kushner&#x2019;s creative reconstruction of the teachers&#x2019; lives and times, we enter the study halls and sit at the feet of these spiritual masters to learn what each discovered about God&#x2019;s Self and ourselves as they ascend and descend Jacob&#x2019;s ladder. </p> <p>In this illuminating journey, our spiritual guides ask and answer the fundamental questions of human experience: Who am I? Who is God? What is God&#x2019;s role in history? What is the nature of evil? How should I relate to God and other people? Could the universe really have a self? </p> <p>Rabbi Lawrence Kushner brilliantly reclaims a millennium of Jewish spirituality for contemporary seekers of all faiths and backgrounds. <i>God Was in This Place &amp; I, i Did Not Know </i>is about God and about you; it is about discovering God&#x2019;s place in the universe, and yours. </p></p><p><i>God Was in This Place &amp; I, I Did Not Know</i> is about seven different ways to read the Bible verse quoted in its title (Genesis 28:16). The titular verse is Jacob's exclamation upon awakening from his vision of angels ascending and descending a ladder to heaven. For centuries, readers have tried to imagine what the angels were trying to tell Jacob; Rabbi Lawrence Kushner has now surveyed some of the most illuminating reflections on that question. The book's sources range from Shmuel bar Nachmnani in third-century Palestine, to Hannah Rachel Werbermacher of Ludomir, who lived in 18th-century Poland. Kushner blends these rabbinic interpretations with his own reflections on Jacob's vision in a strong, impassioned style. <i>God Was in This Place</i> is not only about the Jacob story, however; it is, most importantly, a brilliant book about the way that Scripture offers meaning: "Biblical words shatter and rearrange themselves before our sustained gaze," Kushner writes. "As we read in Jeremiah, 'My word is like fire, says the Lord, and like a hammer that shatters the rock.'" <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p><strong>Lawrence Kushner</strong>, author, lecturer and spiritual leader, is regarded as one of the most creative religious thinkers and writers in America. A commentator on National Public Radio's <em>All Things Considered,</em> he has focused us on spiritual renewal with wisdom and humor. Through his books and lectures, people of every faith and background have found inspiration and new strength for spiritual search and growth. It has been said that some spiritual leaders blend religion and psychology to help us walk better on the ground, but Lawrence Kushner draws on the wisdom of the mystics to help us dance better on the ceiling.</p> <p>Kushner's acclaimed books include <em>I&#x2019;m God; You&#x2019;re Not: Observations on Organized Religion &amp; Other Disguises of the Ego</em>; <em>Honey from the Rock: An Easy Introduction to Jewish Mysticism</em>;<em> Invisible Lines of Connection: Sacred Stories of the Ordinary</em>;<em> The Book of Letters: A Mystical Hebrew Alphabet</em>;<em> Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction for Christians</em>;<em> </em>and<em> In God&#x2019;s Hands</em>, an inspiring fable for children, with Gary Schmidt (all Jewish Lights).</p> <p>Kushner served as rabbi at Congregation Beth El in Sudbury, Massachusetts, for almost thirty years; he is currently the Emanu-El scholar at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, and an adjunct faculty member at Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion.

He enjoys Mozart, hanging around sailboats, and making his granddaughters giggle.</p></p><h2>Marian Apparitions</h2><p>This groundbreaking book looks at the major approved Marian apparitions of the last five centuries and relates them to important historical moments: the Reformation, the French and Russian Revolutions, the rise of Nazism. These Marian apparitions, and particularly Fatima, are not historically unimportant events, but rather follow a preordained plan: they have a crucial role in helping us to see how the modern world, with all its problems, has developed. Donal Foley makes clear the fascinating and intriguing connections between Marian apparitions and the Scriptural types of Mary found in the Bible, a crucial element in the theology and exegesis of the early Church Fathers. By understanding these biblical types and their symbolism we see that each of the apparitions has a much greater significance for both the Church and the modern world than has generally been recognised. Here is a convincing demonstration that the future of the Church, and the papacy, is intimately bound up with a proper understanding of the role of Mary: there will only be true peace in the world when her message is accepted and lived. If you thought you really understood how the modern world developed, and the role and meaning of Marian apparitions, then this book will make you think again. &#39;Donal Foley has written a book with an extraordinary message.&#39; Aidan Nichols,O.P. &#39;A very important contribution to our understanding and appreciation of private revelations. Far from being random events without relation to divine Providence or substitutes and supplements of public revelation, the approved Marian apparitions of modern times (beginning with that of Guadalupe in Mexico in 1531) reveal a pattern foretold in the Bible.these revelations are events at the center of the history in which they occur and in virtue of the biblical typology which they incorporate so profoundly enable us correctly to interpret and participate in that history. Not only scholars and believers, but also the general public will find this volume informative and inspirational.&#39; Peter M. Fehlner, F.I. Donal Anthony Foley has degrees in Humanities and Theology and lives in Nottingham, England. He now combines writing with part-time teaching.

It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night before he went to bed he took the key from a vase, and wound it up. Once a year the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging packhorse, to clean and oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother, and tell her the news of the city and what he had learned in the villages through which he had passed. My father, if he were not busy milling, would stalk out at this time, with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show much enthusiasm, but he listened to them.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk; and only brought out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, like Harvest Festival, or a Capping. The clockman was only allowed to see to it every third year, and at such times my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front was printed &#x201c;Anti-magnetique Incabloc,&#x201d; which we supposed must have been the name of the craftsman who made it in olden times.<br> <br>The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to touch my father&#x2019;s desk and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two, I admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me.<br> <br>On Saturday morning, I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the mill room, grinding, and the servants&#x2014;even Molly who normally did not leave the house during the day&#x2014;had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished my homework, and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch, with small chance of detection.<br> <br>The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside my father&#x2019;s bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a couple of turns it would run down quite soon&#x2014;just in case my father decided to look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking. Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was wearing the Watch.<br> <br>Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a triumph, but to be seen wearing it ... I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I would meet him that morning, in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next Capping, was the person, next to my parents, that I most admired. To take the Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already gone so far, it was easier to contemplate it. My mind made up, I was determined to waste none of the precious time I had. I opened the front door, stuck the hand with the Watch deep into my trouser pocket, and ran off down the street.<br> <br>The village lay at a crossroads, with the road in which our house stood running alongside the river (this giving power for the mill, of course) and the second road crossing it at the ford. Beside the ford stood a small wooden bridge for foot travelers, and I pelted across, noticing that the river was higher than usual from the spring rains. My Aunt Lucy was approaching the bridge as I left it at the far end. She called a greeting to me, and I called back, having first taken care to veer to the other side of the road. The baker&#x2019;s shop was there, with trays of buns and cakes set out, and it was reasonable that I should be heading that way: I had a couple of pennies in my pocket. But I ran on past it, and did not slacken to a walk until I had reached the point where the houses thinned out and at last ended.<br> <br>The ruins were a hundred yards farther on. On one side of the road lay Spiller&#x2019;s meadow, with cows grazing, but on my side there was a thorn hedge, and a potato field beyond. I passed a gap in the hedge, not looking in my concentration on what I was going to show Jack, and was startled a moment later by a shout from behind me. I recognized the voice as Henry Parker&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Henry, like Jack, was a cousin of mine&#x2014;my name is Will Parker&#x2014;but, unlike Jack, no friend. (I had several cousins in the village: people did not usually travel far to marry.) He was a month younger than I, but taller and heavier, and we had hated each other as long as I could remember. When it came to fighting, as it very often did, I was outmatched physically, and had to rely on agility and quickness if I were not going to be beaten. From Jack I had learned some skill in wrestling which, in the past year, had enabled me to hold my own more, and in our last encounter I had thrown him heavily enough to wind him and leave him gasping for breath. But for wrestling one needed the use of both hands. I thrust my left hand deeper into the pocket and, not answering his call, ran on toward the ruins.<br> <br>He was closer than I had thought, though, and he pounded after me, yelling threats. I put a spurt on, looked back to see how much of a lead I had, and found myself slipping on a patch of mud. (Cobbles were laid inside the village, but out here the road was in its usual poor condition, aggravated by the rains.) I fought desperately to keep my footing, but would not, until it was too late, bring out my other hand to help balance myself. As a result, I went slithering and sprawling and finally fell. Before I could recover, Henry was kneeling across me, holding the back of my head with his hand and pushing my face down into the mud.<br> <br>This activity would normally have kept him happy for some time, but he found something of greater interest. I had instinctively used both hands to protect myself as I fell, and he saw the Watch on my wrist. In a moment he had wrenched it off, and stood up to examine it. I scrambled to my feet, and made a grab, but he held it easily above his head and out of my reach.<br> <br>I said, panting, &#x201c;Give that back!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not yours,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your father&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>I was in agony in case the Watch had been damaged, broken maybe, in my fall, but even so I attempted to get my leg between his, to drop him. He parried, and, stepping back, said,<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep your distance.&#x201d; He braced himself, as though preparing to throw a stone. &#x201c;Or I&#x2019;ll see how far I can fling it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you do,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll get a whipping for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a grin on his fleshy face. &#x201c;So will you. And your father lays on heavier than mine does. I&#x2019;ll tell you what: I&#x2019;ll borrow it for a while. Maybe I&#x2019;ll let you have it back this afternoon. Or tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someone will see you with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He grinned again. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll risk that.&#x201d;<br> <br>I made a grab at him, I had decided that he was bluffing about throwing it away. I almost got him off balance, but not quite. We swayed and struggled, and then crashed together and rolled down into the ditch by the side of the road. There was some water in it, but we went on fighting, even after a voice challenged us from above. Jack&#x2014;for it was he who had called to us to get up&#x2014;had to come down and pull us apart by force. This was not difficult for him. He was as big as Henry, and tremendously strong also. He dragged us back up to the road, got to the root of the matter, took the Watch off Henry, and dismissed him with a clip across the back of the neck.<br> <br>I said tearfully, &#x201c;Is it all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think so.&#x201d; He examined it, and handed it to me. &#x201c;But you were a fool to bring it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wanted to show it to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not worth it,&#x201d; he said briefly. &#x201c;Anyway, we&#x2019;d better see about getting it back. I&#x2019;ll lend a hand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack had always been around to a lend a hand, as long as I could remember. It was strange, I thought, as we walked toward the village, that in just over a week&#x2019;s time I would be on my own. The Capping would have taken place, and Jack would be a boy no longer.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Jack stood guard while I put the Watch back and returned the drawer key to the place where I had found it. I changed my wet and dirty trousers and shirt, and we retraced our steps to the ruins. No one knew what these buildings had once been, and I think one of the things that attracted us was a sign, printed on a chipped and rusted metal plate:<br> DANGER<br>6,600 VOLTS<p></p> <br>We had no idea what Volts had been, but the notion of danger, however far away and long ago, was exciting. There was more lettering, but for the most part the rust had destroyed it. LECT CITY: we wondered if that were the city it had come from.<br> <br>Farther along was the den Jack had made. One approached it through a crumbling arch; inside it was dry, and there was a place to build a fire. Jack had made one before coming out to look for me, and had skinned, cleaned, and skewered a rabbit ready for us to grill. There would be food in plenty at home&#x2014;the midday meal on a Saturday was always lavish&#x2014;but this did not prevent my looking forward greedily to roast rabbit with potatoes baked in the embers of the fire. Nor would it stop me doing justice to the steak pie my mother had in the oven. Although on the small side, I had a good appetite.<br> <br>We watched and smelled the rabbit cooking in companionable silence. We could get on very well together without much conversation, though normally I had a ready tongue. Too ready, perhaps&#x2014;I knew that a lot of the trouble with Henry arose because I could not avoid trying to get a rise out of him whenever possible.<br> <br>Jack was not much of a talker under any circumstances, but to my surprise, after a time he broke the silence. His talk was inconsequential at first, chatter about events that had taken place in the village, but I had the feeling that he was trying to get around to something else, something more important. Then he stopped, stared in silence for a second or two at the crisping carcass, and said,<br> <br>&#x201c;This place will be yours, after the Capping.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was difficult to know what to say. I suppose if I had thought about it at all, I would have expected that he would pass the den on to me, but I had not thought about it. One did not think much about things connected with the Cappings, and certainly did not talk about them. For Jack, of all people, to do so was surprising, but what he said next was more surprising still.<br> <br>&#x201c;In a way,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;I almost hope it doesn&#x2019;t work. I&#x2019;m not sure I wouldn&#x2019;t rather be a Vagrant.&#x201d;<br> <br>I should say something about the Vagrants. Every village generally had a few&#x2014;at that time there were four in ours, as far as I knew&#x2014;but the number was constantly changing as some moved off and others took their place. They occasionally did a little work, but whether they did or not the village supported them. They lived in the Vagrant House, which in our case stood on the corner where the two roads crossed and was larger than all but a handful of houses (my father&#x2019;s being one). It could easily have accommodated a dozen Vagrants, and there had been times when there had been almost that many there. Food was supplied to them&#x2014;it was not luxurious, but adequate&#x2014;and a servant looked after the place. Other servants were sent to lend a hand when the House filled up.<br> <br>What was known, though not discussed, was that the Vagrants were people for whom the Capping had proved a failure. They had Caps, as normal people did, but they were not working properly. If this were going to happen, it usually showed itself in the first day or two following a Capping: the person who had been Capped showed distress, which increased as the days went by, turning at last into a fever of the brain. In this state, they were clearly in much pain. Fortunately the crisis did not last long; fortunately also, it happened only rarely. The great majority of Cappings were entirely successful. I suppose only about one in twenty produced a Vagrant.<br> <br>When he was well again, the Vagrant would start his wanderings. He, or she; because it happened occasionally with girls, although much more rarely. Whether it was because they saw themselves as being outside the community of normal people, or because the fever had left a permanent restlessness in them, I did not know. But off they would go and wander through the land, stopping a day here, as long as a month there, but always moving on. Their minds, certainly, had been affected. None of them could settle to a train of thought for long, and many had visions, and did strange things.<br> <br>They were taken for granted, and looked after, but, like the Cappings, not much talked about. Children, generally, viewed them with suspicion and avoided them. They, for their part, mostly seemed melancholy, and did not talk much, even to each other. It was a great shock to hear Jack say he half wished to be a Vagrant, and I did not know how to answer him. But he did not seem to need a response. He said, &#x201c;The Watch&#x2014;do you ever think what it must have been like in the days when things like that were made?&#x201d;<br> <br>I had, from time to time, but it was another subject on which speculation was not encouraged, and Jack had never talked in this way before. I said, &#x201c;Before the Tripods?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, we know it was the Black Age. There were too many people, and not enough food, so that people starved, and fought each other, and there were all kinds of sicknesses, and ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And things like the Watch were made&#x2014;by men, not the Tripods.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;four years ago, when I went to stay with my Aunt Matilda?&#x201d;<br> <br>I remembered. She was his aunt, not mine, even though we were cousins: she had married a foreigner. Jack said, &#x201c;She lives at Bishopstoke, on the other side of Winchester. I went out one day, walking, and I came to the sea. There were the ruins of a city that must have been twenty times as big as Winchester.&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew of the ruined great-cities of the ancients, of course. But these, too, were little talked of, and then with disapproval and a shade of dread. No one would dream of going near them. It was disquieting even to think of looking at one, as Jack had done. I said, &#x201c;Those were the cities where all the murdering and sickness were.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So we are told.

("Where do they keep the Royal Ear, I wonder? I think of it as very large--as big as a dinner tray--and very red, angrily red.") But after life there's death. Guided by an aborigine named Phar Lap Jones, she is transported by a Greek Cypriot minicab driver to the North London dead neighborhood of Dulston. There, accompanied by her dead son, Rude Boy, she's introduced to the 12-step Personally Dead meetings, and she watches over her living daughters--the cold, ambitious Charlotte, and her favorite, the heroin-addicted Natasha. "Natasha is peculiarly charged by the drug--and even by the mere anticipation of its effects. She shifts from being vulnerable and skittish and withdrawn to being strong and steady and extrovert. She's told me before that it makes her feel 'complete' and 'confident,' and I can see what she means. When she's off heroin she's a fucking nightmare--when she's on it she's a peach."<p> Since Will Self's face, voice, and, notoriously, life story are familiar to many who will never pick up his fiction, there's always the risk of reading <i>How the Dead Live</i> as autobiography. In which case, he's clearly based Lily on his New York-born Jewish mother, and he's wittily retooled large chunks of his own much-publicized addictions, transmuting himself into the beautiful and glamorously doomed Natasha. But Lily is feisty and articulate, with a complex history spanning two continents, two husbands, and a constantly re-created personality--a great literary creation. Self's sympathetic account of Lily's decline into her morphine-laden deathbed is deeply affecting, and his long-term obsession with London provides us with the utterly convincing Dulston. His treatment of modern Jewish life in North London (rather than New York) will find its fans and critics, but the novel grows beyond such local concerns. Ultimately, it is about the vexed relationship between the worries of contemporary Western life and a more transcendent spirituality--signaled by Self's opening gesture to <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> and by the all-seeing Phar Lap Jones. <i>How the Dead Live</i> is a big book with big ideas, and quite definitely Will Self's most ambitious and mature work to date. <i>--Alan Stewart</i></p>There's a lot of abusive palaver and not much substance in this labored third novel from the punk-surrealist author of <i>Cock and Bull</i> (1993), <i>Great Apes</i> (1997), and other fetchingly deranged assaults on good taste, convention, and stuff like that.One wants to admire an imagination that could conceive of this novel's afterlife-a rundown hinterland in which the dead hold jobs and intermingle more or less normally by the living-as experienced by its foul-mouthed narrator Lily Bloom (James Joyce is surely spinning peevishly in his grave), an American woman who dies of cancer in a London hospital. But Lily simply rattles on and on, about her two daughters, uptight Charlotte (who's infertile) and cokehead-whore Natasha ("Natty," who's anything but); her many marital and extra-curricular sexual frolics; the State of the World, as encapsulated in odd little throwaway observations ("Saddam invaded Kuwait and my girls indulged their own cravings"); and-most curiously-her relationship before and after death with fellow patient Phar Lap Jones, an affable aborigine (named after his country-creature, a famed racehorse) who covets Lily's false teeth, for which he bargains, promising to ferry her safely out of the land of the living. A few cheeky inventions amuse intermittently (sex is still available even after one has passed on, though Lily wryly notes that "live johns were numb to the dead hookers' insubstantiality"), but there simply isn't enough of a plot to justify even two hundred and fifty pages' worth of this jaded mockery. Nor is Lily much fun: she's a bundle of indignations, whose high-pitched rants accommodate far too many lame anti-Semitic gags (of course she's a Jew herself, so we're probably supposed to see the humor in her continual recourse to such conversational bytes as "D'jew know?" and "Mindjew").Sentence by sentence, it's smooth, even vivid-but the grossly overextended whole adds up to good writing wasted on an underimagined and tiresome premise. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

She journeys to Idaho&#39;s Flathead Reservation for answers but discovers some locals who will stop at nothing to keep certain secrets hidden.</p><p>Sharon McCone (<i>A Walk Through the Fire</i>, <i>McCone &amp; Friends</i>, <i>Both Ends of the Night</i>, etc.) is used to solving problems. She's been doing it for over 20 years in Marcia Muller's pioneering and acclaimed series about the San Francisco PI. And thanks to her extended and occasionally dysfunctional family, she's no stranger to the consequences of revealing the occasional skeleton in the closet. But her latest case is both personal and deeply devastating. After her father dies, Sharon discovers documents that have been hidden for her entire life and they launch her on a voyage of self-discovery. Intent on exploring her own past, Sharon travels from a Shoshone Indian reservation in Montana to a ghost town in northern California, and she becomes involved in a larger story of deceit--and murder. <p> Writing a series means treading delicately on a high wire between repetition and revelation. Having once created a character who will voyage through two or 10 or 10,000 books, an author must decide what facets of the character's life will reappear as touchstones in each book, what items may be left by the wayside, how the past will inform the present, and how the present will indicate the future. With each new novel, the author reaches out to readers who may be comfortably familiar with the series and to readers who may be discovering it for the first time. There is no shortage of mystery writers whose series are immensely rewarding (think Sara Paretsky or Sue Grafton), but it's a difficult balancing act nonetheless. With <i>Listen to the Silence</i>, Marcia Muller seems to stumble slightly, just enough to leave readers wondering whether a safety net is in order. It's as if the burden of the past becomes too heavy for either character or author to support. Sharon seems a trifle flat, and Muller's integration of family and familiarity seems forced and abrupt. A first-time reader would do well to seek out earlier volumes in the series, but confirmed Muller fans will still relish the intensity with which the novel plunges into deeply unsettling territory. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>Marcia Muller has written many novels and short stories.

It is divided into three sections: the Agrarian South, the Industrial North, and the Frontier West (everything west of the Hudson River, that is). An introductory text to each section summarizes the political, social, and cultural forces that enabled the building of these opulent mansions. The excellent color photographs include both interior and exterior views, and, of necessity, give only a taste of the treasures to be found in these 53 houses. All the homes are maintained in period style, and many are open to the public. While not a necessary purchase for many libraries, this book will provide readers with a tantalizing glimpse into a way of life that even in its time was experienced by only a few.

Benjamin Skinner</b> was born in Wisconsin and is a graduate of Wesleyan University. He has reported on a wide range of topics from Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East for such publications as <i>Newsweek International</i>, <i>Travel + Leisure</i>, and <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. He currently lives in Brooklyn. This is his first book.<b></b><p><b>Chapter One</b><b></b></p><p><b>The Riches of the Poor</b></p><p>For our purposes, let's say that the center of the moral universe is in Room S-3800 of the UN Secretariat, Manhattan. From here, you are some five hours from being able to negotiate the sale, in broad daylight, of a healthy boy or girl. Your slave will come in any color you like, as Henry Ford said, as long as it's black. Maximum age: fifteen. He or she can be used for anything. Sex or domestic labor are the most frequent uses, but it's up to you.</p><p>Before you go, et's be clear on what you are buying. A slave is a human being who is forced to work through fraud or threat of violence for no pay beyond subsistence. Agreed? Good. You may have thought you missed your chance to own a slave. Maybe you imagined that slavery died along with the 360,000 Union soldiers whose blood fertilized the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment. Perhaps you assumed that there was meaning behind the dozen international conventions banning the slave trade, or that the deaths of 30 million people in world wars had spread freedom across the globe.</p><p>But you're in luck. By our mere definition, you are living at a time when there are more slaves than at any point in history. If you're going to buy one in five hours, however, you've really got to stop navel-gazing over things like law and the moral advance of humanity. Get a move on.</p><p>First, hail a taxi to JFK International Airport. If you choose the Queensboro Bridge to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the drive should take under an hour. With no baggage, you'll speed through security in time to make a direct flight to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Flying time: three hours.</p><p>The final hour is the strangest. After disembarking, you will cross the tarmac to the terminal where drummers in vodou getup and a dancing midget greet you with song. Based on Transportation Security Administration warnings posted in the departure terminal at JFK, you might expect abject chaos at Toussaint L'Ouverture Airport. Instead, you find orderly lines leading to the visa stamp, no bribes asked, a short wait for your bag, then a breeze through customs. Outside the airport, the cabbies and porters will be aggressive, but not threatening. Assuming you speak no Creole, find an English-speaking porter and offer him $20 to translate for the day.</p><p>Ask your translator to hail the most common form of transport, a tap�tap, a flatbed pickup retrofitted with benches and a brightly colored canopy. You will have to take a couple of these, but they only cost 10 gourdes (25 cents) each. Usually handpainted with signs in broken English or Creole, tap�taps often include the words MY GOD or JESUS. MY GOD IT'S MY LIFE reads one; another announces WELCOME TO JESUS. Many are ornate, featuring windshields covered in frill, doodads, and homages to such figures as Che Guevara, Ronaldinho, or reggae legend Gregory Isaacs. The driver's navigation is based on memory, instinct. There will be no air conditioning. Earplugs are useful, as the sound system, which cost more than the rig itself, will make your chest vibrate with the beats of Haitian pop and American hip�hop. Up to twenty people may accompany you: five square inches on a wooden bench will miraculously accommodate a woman with a posterior the size of a tractor tire. Prepare your spine.</p><p>You'll want to head up Route de Delmas toward the suburb of P�tionville, where many of the �country's wealthiest thirty families -- who control the nation's economy -- maintain a pied-�-terre. As you drive southeast away from the sea, the smells change from rotting fish to rotting vegetables. Exhaust fumes fill the air. You'll pass a billboard featuring a smiling girl in pigtails and the words: <i>Give me your hand</i>. <i>Give me tomorrow</i>. <i>Down with Child Servitude</i>. Chances are, like the majority of Haitians, you �can't read French or Creole. Like them, you ignore the sign.</p><p>Heading out of the airport, you'll pass two UN peacekeepers, one with a Brazilian patch, the other with an Argentine flag. As you pass the blue helmets, smile, wave, and receive dumbfounded stares in return. The United Nations also has Jordanians and Peruvians here, parked in APVs fifteen minutes northwest, along the edge of the hyperviolent Cit� Soleil slum, the poorest and most densely populated six square miles in the poorest and most densely populated country in the hemisphere. The peacekeepers don't go in much, neither do the national police. If they do, the gangsters that run the place start shooting. Best to steer clear, although you'd get a cheap price on children there. You might even get offered a child gratis.</p><p>You'll notice the streets of the Haitian capital are, like the tap-taps, overstuffed, banged up, yet colorful. The road surfaces range from bad to terrible, and grind even the toughest SUVs down to the chassis. Parts of Delmas are so steep that the truck may sputter and die under the exertion.</p><p>Port-au-Prince was built to accommodate about 150,000 people, and hasn't seen too many centrally planned upgrades since 1804. Over the last fifty years, some 2 million people, a quarter of the nation's population, have arrived from the countryside. They've brought their animals. Chickens scratch on side streets, and boys lead prizefighting cocks on string leashes. Monstrously fat black pigs root in sooty, putrid garbage piled eight feet high on street corners or even higher in enormous pits that drop off sidewalks and wind behind houses.</p><p>A crowd swells out of a Catholic church broadcasting a fervent mass. Most Haitians are Catholic. Despite the efforts of Catholic priests, most also practice vodou. In the countryside, vodou is often all they practice.</p><p>You may see a white jeep or van with a siren, a red cross, and the word ambulence handpainted on it. You might assume this is an ambulance. It is not. These private vehicles only carry dead people. Public health is spotty at best. The annual budget for the health care of the UN peacekeepers in Haiti is greater than the annual budget for the �ountry's Health Ministry. It's a bad idea to get sick here, as I was to find out.</p><p>At night, those with homes pack into tin-roofed, plywood, or cinder-block dwellings, on dirt roads bisected by gullies of raw sewage. Most people loot electricity from street wires to enjoy a light or two until rolling blackouts enshroud the city and end the sounds of dancehall reggae and hip-hop. Then total darkness reigns, and total silence, save for the spasmodic barking of dogs, and the nightly gunfire that can be heard from Cit� Soleil to P�tionville. Only the generator-driven lights of the fortified UN compounds illuminate the haze over the city.</p><p>But now, in the daytime, many Haitians, particularly the 70 percent with no formal employment, will be on the sweaty, steamy, dusty streets. When either gender needs to urinate, they simply find a quiet pole or a ditch. No point going home for relief since few have indoor plumbing. Haitians take great pride in their appearance, but as more than three quarters live on less than two dollars per day, they don't have many pieces in their wardrobe. Some beg, like the thirtysomething woman sitting in the middle of Delmas, one horribly infected breast, glistening with pus, hanging out of her shirt.</p><p>Some hustle. There are more than 10,000 street kids, mostly boys as young as six, some selling unprotected sex for $1.75. Haiti has the highest prevalence of HIV infection outside of sub-Saharan Africa, and Haitians who believe sex with virgins protects against, or even cures, AIDS have driven up the price of such intercourse to $5.00. Haiti has also become a magnet for sex tourists and pedophiles. One left a review of the children in an online chatroom: "The younger ones are even more kinker [sic] than the older women....Park on the street and tell them to go at it!!!!!!!!! If anyone sees you they just ignore you. No police but the multi-national military force is still here." Locals say that the main contribution of the peacekeepers to Haiti's economy comes via the brothels. Opposite a UN camp on an otherwise desolate road outside of Port-au-Prince, Le Perfection nightclub does booming business.</p><p>Most city dwellers who work do so on an ad hoc basis. A doubled-over, shirtless man strains under a donkey cart laden with the burnt-out carcass of a car. An elderly woman balances a hundred eggs in five tiers on her head and nimbly navigates a pulverized side road. A young man pushes up the bustling sidewalk with two queen-sized mattresses on his head. The tinkling of shoeshine bells is constant. An old man -- probably no more than fifty-seven, the average life span for a Haitian -- pushes a wheelbarrow filled with empty bottles. He catches you smiling at his threadbare, oversized T-shirt bearing an image of Snoopy, Woodstock, and the words WORLD'S MOST HUGGABLE GRANDMA. Bubbling with good humor, he shoots back a toothless grin. Many peddle trinkets, bouillon cubes, single-shot plastic bags of water, plantain chips, "Megawatt" energy soda, or vegetables in various states of decay.</p><p>A man hawks cell phone chargers with which he swats stray dogs as they slink by. Another man on Delmas sells cowhide <i>rigwaz whips</i> and leather martinets. Those are for beating a different kind of creature. "<i>Timoun se ti bet</i>," a Haitian saying relates: "Children are little animals." "<i>Ti neg se baton ki fe I mache</i>," goes another: "It is the whip which makes the little guy walk."</p><p>You are now about halfway up Delmas, and slaves are everywhere. Assuming that this is your first trip to Haiti, you won't be able to identify them. But to a lower-middle-class Haitian, their status is "written in blood." Some are as young as three or four years old. But they'll always be the small ones, even if they're older. The average fifteen-year-old child slave is 1.5 inches shorter and 40 pounds lighter than the average free fifteen-year-old. They may have burns from cooking for their overseer's family over an open fire; or scars from beatings, sometimes in...</p></p><h2>Quest for the Spark: Book Three: A BONE Companion (BONE: Quest for the Spark)</h2><p><b>The thrilling conclusion to the NEW YORK TIMES bestselling Quest for the Spark trilogy!</b><br><br>The Nacht is growing stronger, and it's a race against time for Tom Elm and friends to find the final piece of the Spark before the entire Valley--and possibly the world--are plunged into eternal darkness.

As far as the Red Dragon could see were bodies, all caught in the grip of an endless sleep. Holy men lay scattered amongst the normal folk of the Valley; royalty slumbered with dragons. Each and every one having fallen victim to the growing power of the Nacht. The situation was far worse than the Red Dragon had ever imagined, but there was still a chance that the Nacht could be defeated. For the Dreaming had seen this threat--the threat of all-consuming darkness--and had planned. Just in case. &#34;Your silence speaks volumes, brother,&#34; the Nacht growled happily, as he walked amongst those who slept. He stopped before what appeared to be a curtain of absolute blackness. &#34;Beyond this wall is the prize,&#34; the Nacht purred. He raised a taloned hand and placed it against the obstruction. &#34;The Waking World, just waiting for the darkness to flow like an ocean over the land.&#34; The Dragon ran his razor-sharp claws over the shadow wall, slivers of night raining down to be lost amongst the shadows at his feet. &#34;Already the work has begun,&#34; he continued. &#34;Little by little, piece by piece, the wall is coming down.&#34; The last thought to go through the Red Dragon&#39;s mind before sleep claimed him once more was that there was still a chance for this nightmare to end.

Now that civilization dares to rule here, a lighthouse penetrates the last and wildest place of all. But Vasquez, the guardian of the sacred light, has not reckoned with the vicious, desperate Kongre gang, who murder his two friends and force him out into the wilderness. Alone, without resources, can he foil their cruel plans? &nbsp;A gripping tale of passion and perseverance, Verne&#x2019;s testament novel paints a compelling picture of intrigue and heroism, schemes and calamities.

Topf and Sons designed and built the crematoria at the concentration camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Buchenwald, Belzec, Dachau, Mauthausen, and Gusen. At its height, 66 Topf triple muffle ovens were in operation&#x2015;46 of which were at Auschwitz. </p><p> These were not Nazi sadists, but men who were playboys and the sons of train conductors. They were driven not by ideology, but by love affairs, personal ambition, and bitter personal rivalries. Even while their firm created the ultimate human killing and disposal machines, their company sheltered Nazi enemies from the death camps. The intense conflagration of their very ordinary motives created work that surpassed in inhumanity even the demands of the SS. </p><p> But the company that achieved this spectacularly evil feat of engineering typify the banality of evil. In the 1930s their family firm produced apparatus for all sorts of industries&#x2015;baking, brewing, the firing of ceramics. Ovens for crematoria accounted for only a small proportion of their business, but it is for these that the Topf brothers became infamous.

But when I was a child, I was a girl on Wideacre. A girl who knew everything, and yet knew nothing. A girl who could see the past all around as she walked on the land -- dimly, like firelit smoke. And could see the future in bright glimpses -- like moonlight through storm-torn clouds. The unstoppable hints of past and future molded my childhood like drips of water on a tortuous limestone stalactite that grows and grows into a strange racked shape, knowing nothing.<br><br>Oh! I know now. I have been a fool. I was a fool over and over in the years when I learned to be a woman. But I am no fool now. I had to shed the shell of lies and half-truths like a summertime adder coming out of a sloughed skin. I had to scrape the scales of lies off my very eyes so that I blinked in the strong light of the truth at last; and was a fool no more. In the end I was the only one that dared to face the truth. In the end I was quite alone. In the end there was only me. Only me and the land.<br><br>It is no ordinary land -- that is our explanation and our excuse. This is Wideacre, set on the very chalk backbone of southern England, as beautiful and as rich as a garden, as the very first garden of Eden. The South Downs enclose the valley of the River Fenny like a cupped hand. High chalk downs, sweet with short-cropped grass and rare meadow flowers, dizzy in summer with tiny blue butterflies. These hills were my horizon. My little world was held inside them. At its center was the hall, Wideacre Hall. A smoke-blackened ruin at the head of the chalk-mud and flintstone drive, tumbling down amid an overgrown rose garden where no one walks. In the old days the carriages would roll past the front door and down the drive, passing fertile fields, passing the little square sandstone Dower House, stopping at the great iron gates at the head of the drive for the lodgekeeper to swing them open for a tossed coin or a nod. To the left is the village of Acre -- a lane lined with tradesmen's cottages, a whitewashed vicarage, a church with a pretty rounded spire; to the right is the lane which runs to the London road, meeting it at the corner where the stagecoach stops on its way north to Midhurst and beyond.<br><br>I was born Julia Lacey in 1773, the daughter of the squire of Wideacre and his wife Celia Havering of Havering Hall. I was their only child; there was no male heir. I was raised with my cousin Richard, the son of Beatrice, my father's sister. Those two -- my papa and his sister -- made my cousin and me joint heirs to Wideacre. They changed the entail on the estate so that we two could jointly inherit. We always knew that we were to run Wideacre together.<br><br>Those are the facts. But there is also the truth. The truth that Beatrice was desperate to own her brother's estate, that she lied and schemed and ruined the land and murdered -- oh, yes, the Laceys have always been killers. She stopped at nothing to put herself in the squire's chair. She enclosed fields and shut footpaths, she raised rents and planted wheat everywhere to pay for her plans. She drove her husband half mad and stole his fortune. She dominated her brother in every way a woman can. And she outran her destiny for season after season until the village which had once adored her came against her with torches in their hands and a leader on a black horse riding before them.<br><br>They killed her.<br><br>They killed her. They burned down the house. They ruined the Lacey family. And they put themselves outside the law forever.<br><br>My papa, the squire, died of a weak heart. Beatrice's husband, Dr. John MacAndrew, went away to India, swearing to repay her creditors. And then there were only the three of us left: my mama, my cousin Richard, and me in the square little box of the Dower's house, halfway down the drive from Wideacre Hall with the great trees of the Wideacre parkland leaning over the roof and pressing close to the windows. Three of us, two servants, and a whole world of ghosts.<br><br>I could name them all. I saw them all. Not very clearly. Not well enough to understand with my child's imagination. But at night when I was asleep, I sometimes heard a voice, a word, or an echo of a word. Or once, very clearly, the ripple of a joyous laugh. And once I had a dream so intense that I awoke, in a start of terror, my bedroom windows bright with the reflection of flames from a fire as big as a house, the fire which burned down Wideacre Hall, my house. And killed the squire, my papa. And left three survivors in this house: the three of us and a family of ghosts.<br><br>In real life there was my mama. Her face was heart-shaped, pale like a cream rose, her eyes pansy-brown. Her hair was fair when she was young but went gray -- long aging streaks of dullness among the gold, as if her sorrow and her worry had laid fading fingers on her smooth head. She was widowed when I was only two years old, so I cannot remember her wearing any color other than purple or sage or black. I cannot remember the hall as anything but a ruin. When we were little children, she would revile the dull colors and swear she would marry a great merchant for his stocks of pink shot silk. But as we grew and no merchant arrived, no geese laid golden eggs and no trees grew diamonds, she laughed no more about her old dark gowns, shiny at the seams and worn at the hems.<br><br>And there was Richard. My cousin Richard. My dearest friend, my little tyrant, my best ally, my worst enemy, my fellow conspirator, my betrayer, my playmate, my rival, my betrothed. I cannot remember a time before I loved him. I cannot remember a time before I loved Wideacre. He was as much a part of me, of my childhood, as the downland and common land, as the tall trees of Wideacre woods. I never made a choice about loving him, I never made a choice about loving the land. I loved land and boy because they were at the very heart of me. I could not imagine myself without my love for Richard. I could not imagine myself with any other home than Wideacre, with any other name than Lacey.<br><br>I was blessed in my loves. For Richard, my cousin, was the sweetest of boys, as dear to me as a brother, one of those special children who draw in love as easily as green grass growing. People would turn to smile at him in the streets of Chichester, smile at his light-footed stride, his mop of black curls, his startlingly bright blue eyes, and the radiance of his smile. And anyone who heard him sing would have loved him for that alone. He had one of those innocent boyish voices which soar and soar higher than you can imagine anyone can sing, and the clear purity of each note could make me shiver like a breeze sighing out of the sky from heaven itself. I loved so much to hear him sing that I would volunteer for hours of pianoforte practice and for the discomfort of constantly learning new pieces so that I could play while he sang.<br><br>He loved duets, but neither threats nor blandishments could make me hold a tune. "Listen, Julia! Listen!" he would cry at me, singing a note as pure as spring water, but I could not copy it. Instead I would strum the accompaniment as well as I was able, and sometimes in the evening Mama would hum the lower part while Richard's voice soared and filled the whole of the tiny parlor and drifted out of the half-open window to rival the birdsong in the twilit woods.<br><br>And then, when Richard was singing and the house was still, I could feel them. The ghosts who were always around us, as palpable as the evening mist filtering through the trees from the River Fenny. They were always near, though only I could feel them, and only at certain times. But I knew they were always near, those two -- Richard's mama, Beatrice, and my papa, the squire, who were partners in the flowering and destruction of the Laceys in the short years when they made and wrecked Wideacre.<br><br>And when Richard was singing and my hands were stumbling but picking out the tune and Mama dropped her sewing unnoticed in her lap to listen to that high sweet tone, I knew that they were waiting. Waiting almost like the three of us. For something to happen.<br><br>For something to happen on Wideacre again.<br><br>I was older by a year; but Richard was always bigger than me. I was the daughter of the squire and the only surviving Lacey; but Richard was a boy and the natural master. We were raised as country children, but we were not allowed into the village. We were isolated in threadbare gentility, hidden in the overgrown woods of the Wideacre parkland like a pair of enchanted children in a fairy tale, waiting for the magic to set us free.<br><br>Richard was the leader. It was he who ordered the games and devised the rules; it was I who offended against them. Then Richard would be angry with me and set himself up as judge, jury and executioner, and I would go white-faced and tearful to my mama and complain that Richard had been mean to me, gaining us both a reliably evenhanded punishment. We were often in trouble with my mama, for we were a bad team of petty sinners. Richard was often naughty -- and I could not resist confession.<br><br>I once earned us a scolding from Mama, who had spotted my stained pinafore and taxed me with stealing bottled fruit from the larder. Richard would have brazened it out, blue eyes persuasively wide, but I confessed at once, not only to the theft of the bottle of fruit, but also to stealing a pot of jam days before, which had not even been missed.<br><br>Richard said nothing as we left Mama's parlor, our eyes on the carpet, uncomfortably guilty. Richard said nothing all morning. But later that afternoon we were playing by the river and he was paddling in midstream when he suddenly said, "Hush!" and urgently beckoned me in beside him. He said there was a kingfisher's nest, but when I tucked my skirts up and paddled in alongside him, I could not see it.<br><br>"There!" he said, pointing to the bank. "There!" But I could see nothing. As I turned, he took both my hands in a hard grip and his face changed from smiles to his darkest scowl. He pulled me closer to him and held me tight so I could not escape and hissed, "There are water snakes in this river, Julia, and they are sliding out of their holes to come for you."<br><br>He needed to do no more. The ripples in the river were at once the bow waves from the broad heads of brown water snakes. The touch of a piece of weed against my ankle was its wet body coiling around my bare foot. The splash of a piece of driftwood in the flow was a venomous dark-eyed snake slithering in the river toward me. Not until I was screaming with terror, my cheeks wet with tears and my wrists red from trying to pull away, would the little tyrant let me go, so that I could scramble for the bank and fling myself out of the water in a frenzy of fear.<br><br>And then, as if my tears were some cure for his rage, he forgave me. He took my handkerchief out of my pocket and dried my eyes. He put his arm around me and talked to me in a tender voice, and petted me, and called me sweet little names. And finally, irresistibly, he sang for me my favorite folk songs about shepherds and farming and the land and crops growing ripely and easily, and I forgot to cry, I forgot my tears, I forgot my terror. I even forgot that Richard had been bullying me at all. I nuzzled my head into his neck and let him stroke my hair with his muddy hand, and I sat on his lap and listened to all the songs he could remember until he was tired of singing.<br><br>When we splashed home in the golden sunlight of the summer evening and Mama exclaimed at my dress, my pinafore, my hair all wet and muddy, I told her that I had fallen in the river and bore her reproaches without one murmur. For that I had my reward. Richard came to my bedroom later in the night when Mama was sitting downstairs trying to work by the light of only two candles. He came with his hands full of sweet things begged or stolen from Mrs. Gough, the cook. And he sat beside me on my bed and gave me the best, the very best, of his haul.<br><br>"I love you when you are good, Julia," he said, holding a cherry to my lips so I turned up my face like a questing lapdog.<br><br>"No," I said sadly as I spat out the cherry stone into his warm little palm. "You love me when I am bad. For lying to Mama is not good, but if I had told her about you and the water snakes, she would have had you whipped."<br><br>And Richard laughed carelessly, seeming much older than me, not a year younger.<br><br>"Shhh!" I said suddenly. I had heard a floorboard in the uncarpeted parlor creak and the scrape of her chair.<br><br>Richard gathered the remains of our feast in his hands and slid like a ghost in his nightgown toward the bedroom door. Mama came slowly, slowly up each step as if she were very tired, and Richard melted up the stairs to his attic bedroom at the top of the house. I saw the ribbon of light from Mama's nighttime candle widen as she pushed open my bedroom door. I had my eyes shut tight, but I could never deceive her.<br><br>"Oh, Julia," she said lovingly. "You will be so tired tomorrow if you don't go to sleep at the proper time."<br><br>I sat up in bed and stretched my arms to her for a good-night hug. She smelled faintly of lilies and clean linen. There were lines around her brown eyes and I could tell by the weariness on her face that she had been worrying about money again. But she smiled tenderly at me and the love in her face made her beautiful. There might be a darn on her collar, and her dark dress might be shiny with wear, but just the smell of Mama and the way she walked told you she was Quality born and bred. I sniffed appreciatively and hugged her tight.<br><br>"Were you writing to Uncle John?" I asked as she pulled up my bedclothes and tucked them securely around me.<br><br>"Yes," she said.<br><br>"Did you tell him that Richard wants singing lessons?" I asked.<br><br>"Yes," she said, smiling, but I saw her eyes were grave.<br><br>"Do you think he will send the money?" I asked, my concern for Richard making me press her.<br><br>"I doubt it very much," she said levelly. "There are more important bills to pay first, Julia. There are the Lacey creditors to repay. And we have to save for Richard's schooling. There is not a lot of money to spare."<br><br>Indeed there was not. Mrs. Gough and Stride worked for love, loyalty and a pittance paid monthly in arrears. The food on the table was game from the Havering estate or fish from the Fenny; the vegetables were grown in the kitchen garden, the fruit came from my Grandmama Havering at Havering Hall. And wine was a rare luxury. My dresses were hand-me-downs from my distant Havering cousins, and Richard's shirt collars were turned and turned and turned again until there was neither shirt nor collar left. Mama would accept clothes and food from her mama, my Grandma Havering. But she never applied to her for money. She was too proud. And anyway, the Havering estate, our nearest neighbor, was derelict through neglect itself. My mama's stepfather, Lord Havering, was not an attentive master of the land.<br><br>"Go to sleep, Julia," Mama said softly, taking up her candle and going to the door.<br><br>"Good night," I said, and obediently shut my eyes. But I lay half wakeful, listening as the house settled for the night. I heard Mama's footsteps in her room and the creak of her bed as she sprang in quickly, for the floorboards were icy to bare feet; the nighttime noises of Stride bolting the back door, checking the front door -- as if there were anything to steal! -- and then his heavy tread up the back stairs to his bedroom at the top of the house.<br><br>Then the outside noises: a trailing creeper tapping at a windowpane, the distant call of a barn owl flying low across a dark field and away in the woods the abrupt b...</p><h2>A Headache in the Pelvis: A New Understanding and Treatment for Prostatitis and Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes, Second Edition</h2><p>A Headache in the Pelvis A New Understanding and treatment for prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndromes presents a new and revolutionary understanding and treatment for prostatitis and related pelvic pain syndromes that was developed at Stanford University.

The persecution of the Catholic Church and killing of the king symbolized to the Vend�ens how dangerous the new Republic had become; in a matter of weeks tens of thousands had flocked to fight for the &#x2018;Catholic and Royal&#x2019; cause.<br><br>This is the story of the new Republic&#x2019;s ferocious military campaigns against the armies of the Vend�e, which fiercely defied them between March and December 1793, tying down hundreds of thousands of troops desperately needed on the frontiers. Napoleon later called it &#x2018;The War of Giants&#x2019; and it directly led to the implementation of some of the Republic&#x2019;s most extreme laws.</p><p>Rob Harper has a degree in History and has worked for nearly thirty years as a specialist in the preservation of historic buildings.

Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> is a collection of his best work from the last 50 years (it's got kids stuff, too, which is pretty fascinating). The volume is a welcome reminder that, screwed up as Crumb may be, he's also a tremendously talented, utterly original artist. He artistically embodies a certain segment of the '60s, and as that fades even further into history, Crumb's material becomes more important. Is <i>The R. Crumb Coffee Table Art Book</i> funny? Yes, certainly, in a coarse, Rabelaisian way; you'll either find it a hoot, or horribly racist and sexist. And it's not for the kiddies, obviously. But R. Crumb is so well known by now, that you probably know which group you fall into, the lovers or the haters. The lovers will find this book a wonderful treat.Robert Crumb was born in 1943 in Philadelphia. After a period drawing greeting cards, he began to work with MAD creator Harvey Kurtzman on his new humor magazine, Help! After Help! folded, Crumb heard the siren song of the Summer of Love and moved to San Francisco in 1967. He began drawing LSD-influenced comics for various underground newspapers, including The East Village Other and Yarrowstalks. In 1968, the first issue of Zap Comix was published and Crumb hawked copies from a baby carriage in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Zap Comix was a success and attracted the attention of other artists, including S. Clay Wilson, Victor Moscoso, and Rick Griffin, all of whom joined Zap with issue 2. Crumb&#39;s comics mixed a nostalgia for comics&#39; rich history with a psychedelic exuberance. Crumb produced many more comics in the late sixties and early seventies, including Despair, Motor City, Big Ass Comics, Home Grown Funnies, People&#39;s Comix, and Your Hytone Comics, as well as the books Head Comix and Fritz the Cat. Pursued by hustling businessmen who wanted to merchandise his characters Mr. Natural and Fritz the Cat, Crumb retreated to rural California. In 1981, Crumb started Weirdo, a new anthology magazine featuring his own new work, the comics of a new generation of young cartoonists, and intriguingly strange work by certifiable &#34;outsider&#34; cartoonists. At the same time, Crumb drew several issues of a new solo comic book, Hup. In 1995, Crumb was the subject of an award-winning film biography, Crumb. Recent books and comics include Kafka, Waiting for Food, and Self-Loathing. Crumb lives in France with his wife, the artist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, and their daughter.</p><h2>A Death in White Bear Lake</h2><p>Recounts the brutal murder of four-year-old Dennis Jurgens in 1965 by his adoptive parents, and Dennis&#39;s birth mother&#39;s discovery of the truth more than twenty years later</p><p>t to talk to you about my brother who was murdered twenty-one years ago--can we come in?"

It <br>was not a big room, just large enough for an ironing board, a Singer <br>sewing machine, and a bed. The room was called, in my family, the <br>sewing room. There was nothing forbidding about the little room; it <br>had plenty of light, its colors were pale, and it looked out on the <br>street, a solid bourgeois street of nineteenth-century houses at the <br>unfashionable end of a fashionable district. Some time after moving <br>to 18 Rue Weber, which is near the Porte Maillot in the Sixteenth <br>Arrondissement, the room took on a fearful association. In this room, <br>my parents said, a man -- the owner of the house -- had killed <br>himself. They provided an explanation, impressive and immeasurably <br>big, or so it seemed to me. The man had committed suicide, I was <br>told, the day the Germans marched into Paris. He had been a famous <br>doctor, and he had gone into the room to put a gun to his head (this <br>last part turned out to be incorrect).<br> It had happened in the past. When? Not the distant past, <br>apparently. It was not recited as a kind of gruesome curiosity, as <br>when I was given a lesson out of a guidebook in front of some <br>European monument. This was serious: the tone was solemn. It was <br>something that affected the tellers. My parents had not read about it <br>in a book. The information had come nearly firsthand, or at least <br>from somebody who had a connection to it.<br> My parents had not known this doctor. There was no reason why <br>his action, undoubtedly distressing, should have had any special <br>impact on them. Yet there was something else that gave it force: the <br>history behind it. And so the explanation itself became at least as <br>fearsome a fact as the doctor"s death. The man killed himself because <br>the Germans marched into Paris. For a six-year-old child, born in the <br>United States in 1960, far in time and space from whatever sinister <br>occurrences might have been behind the death of the man, that <br>explanation immediately assumed troubling overtones. This was all the <br>more true because it was associated with a clear image: I thought I <br>knew what "marched" meant. It couldn"t have been good.<br> When I grew older, I tended to dismiss the story. It seemed <br>to be an example of parental exaggeration, even a far-fetched <br>projection of certain inner fears and animosities that themselves <br>might have been legitimate but were unlikely to have had such an <br>intimate link to our mundane family life. There was no use putting <br>oneself into a story not one"s own, or so I thought.<br> It wasn"t until years later that I began coming across <br>references to the suicide of Dr. Thierry de Martel in June 1940. Many <br>books describing the defeat of France in that year mention this <br>notorious death. The historians evoke it as a singular gesture, <br>exemplary in some respects, though there were at least fifteen <br>suicides in Paris that day. Thierry de Martel was a society doctor, <br>an aristocrat who had had a brilliant career, a pioneer of brain <br>surgery in France, and the director of the American Hospital of <br>Paris. As a young man he had been an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, and <br>before the war he had joined anti-parliamentary, anti-Semitic <br>organizations like Action Fran�aise and Faisceau (Fasces). He was a <br>fervent nationalist and a decorated World War I veteran who had lost <br>his son in that war. Thierry de Martel had always told friends that <br>he wouldn"t be able to bear the idea of German troops in Paris. On <br>June 13 he wrote to his friend William Bullitt, the American <br>ambassador: "I made you the promise that I wouldn"t leave Paris. I <br>didn"t say whether I would stay in Paris alive or dead. Alive, I give <br>the enemy a blank check; dead, an uncovered one."<br> On Friday, June 14, 1940, a brilliant sunny day, troops of <br>the Wehrmacht entered the city. They marched up to the Arc de <br>Triomphe and down the Champs-�lys�es. Thierry de Martel had arisen <br>early, shaved, and dressed with his usual care. He heard the troops <br>and their tanks. He went to his study on the second floor, stretched <br>out on the divan, and injected himself with strychnine. His <br>housekeeper found him several hours later, a copy of Victor Hugo"s <br>play Hernani, open to the line "Since one must be tall to die, I <br>arise," by his side. A letter warned against any possible attempt to <br>revive him. Six weeks later the far-right newspaper Candide paid <br>tribute to the memory of "our faithful colleague."1<br> Not long ago, I looked up Thierry de Martel"s name in the <br>Paris telephone book for 1939. At the top of page 889, above an <br>advertisement for a neighborhood confectioner that still exists, I <br>saw "Martel, (Dr. T. de), 18, rue Weber (16e)."<br> A few historians have used the example of the doctor"s <br>suicide to open or close their accounts, a desperate act <br>foreshadowing the period to follow or epitomizing the one just <br>ending.2 For me (and I realized this long after my family had left <br>France), the story also may have been a kind of beginning. It was an <br>ongoing problem to be solved, one that had entered the mind of a <br>small child, survived adolescent skepticism, and been revived in the <br>light of an adult"s greater knowledge and puzzlement. For a long time <br>I was obliged to be reminded of it every day, whenever I walked past <br>that little room. Around it our family life continued, but so did the <br>fact of the doctor"s death. The paradox was this: something old yet <br>bad had happened in there. It had happened a long time ago, yet it <br>continued to be bad. And it had happened because "the Germans marched <br>into Paris."<br> These intruding facts would have seemed striking to me, all <br>the more so in that they coexisted with a familial atmosphere of <br>confidence. Several years ago, watching portions of a French newsreel <br>from 1965, I glimpsed a trace of this atmosphere. In the newsreel, <br>President Charles de Gaulle gives a press conference under the <br>crystal chandeliers of the �lys�e Palace. Visible for an instant <br>among the reporters, standing out because of his height, is a man <br>with dark hair and horn-rimmed glasses. This was my father, then a <br>member of the Washington Post"s Paris office.<br> Assembled amid all this gilt and velvet, my father and his <br>colleagues have a deferential air about them. De Gaulle was God in <br>those years. Some of my earliest childhood memories are infused with <br>his image. On Bastille Day in 1966, I was taken to an outdoor <br>fireworks display, a wondrous occasion culminating logically in the <br>representation of the General himself, his huge nose and peaked <br>French military hat floating in the ether. When I was a small child, <br>de Gaulle seemed to be the reason for my father"s employment, if not <br>his existence. His name was part of the furniture at 18 Rue Weber. <br>Unlike some of the American reporters, my father admired him, seeing <br>as constructive the grandiose ambitions others found absurd. "On <br>balance, the world is deeply in debt to this strange man," he wrote <br>in 1966. Sometimes I would hear the General"s emphatic voice <br>pridefully booming out of our black-and-white television. My father <br>shared this mid-1960s confidence. "The central feature of present-day <br>Europe, both east and west of what used to be called the Iron <br>Curtain, is its comparative affluence," he wrote from Paris. The <br>article, entitled "Notes on the New Europe," is accompanied by a <br>photograph of him sitting at a caf� on the Champs-�lys�es, peering at <br>the newspaper Le Monde.3<br> The late war continued to exist in this optimistic world, but <br>only as a kind of negative foil. The country was moving forward; de <br>Gaulle, as everybody knew, had triumphed in those war years, <br>incarnating the essence of France with his refusal to collaborate. <br>His version of the war"s aftermath -- nothing of the country"s murky <br>collaborationist regime subsisted, and France had been reborn -- was <br>the accepted one. "After the war, he wiped out most vestiges of the <br>Vichy dictatorship and restored France"s democratic institutions," my <br>father wrote in 1966. Our admired family doctor, like many others, <br>had "been in the Resistance," a phrase I remember as being nearly as <br>common as "bonjour." The Marais, the old Jewish quarter, meant Sunday <br>trips to Goldenberg"s restaurant, not roundups of Jews twenty-odd <br>years before. The disciplinarian French schoolteachers who terrorized <br>us were "Nazis," to be successfully resisted by brave parents. Of <br>course, no one in my family had any inkling of Thierry de Martel"s <br>political allegiances.4<br> There would have been a relative lack of interest <br>corresponding, for other reasons, with an attitude that prevailed in <br>France during those years. The country"s official public relation to <br>the war was still untroubled. Paradoxically, the war was both closer <br>in time -- I remember buildings fitted in ancient coats of soot, just <br>as they are in the haunting photographs of occupied Paris -- yet <br>further away than it was to become. In that era, the war was simply a <br>part of history, safely resolved. The French historian Henry Rousso <br>has written that it was in 1964, the year of my family"s arrival in <br>France, that "this new version of the Occupation -- a version most <br>comforting to French sensibilities -- achieved its definitive form: <br>France was now cast as a nation that "forever and always resists the <br>invader," whatever uniform he might wear, be it the gray-green of the <br>German army or the paraphernalia of the Roman legion."5<br> Against this background there was the interior world of the <br>house and the aura of what had happened in the sewing room. What made <br>that event linger? It was not a question I would have asked myself at <br>the age of six. Yet long after most definite memories of that time <br>and place had disappeared, long after I left that house, the doctor"s <br>story stayed in my mind. It stayed even through years in which France <br>was far from my thoughts. Recently I went back to the neighborhood <br>around the Rue Weber for the first time in more than thirty years. <br>Something much less precise than a memory, but palpable nonetheless, <br>had persisted: the scale of the buildings and the angles at which the <br>streets met each other were oddly familiar. It amounted to no more <br>than a vague feeling. Yet the vagueness of this persistence put into <br>sharper relief the memory of the sewing room.<br><br>A woman I met several years ago in the town of Vichy, where I was <br>living while writing this book, asked with some bewilderment what <br>could have motivated me, an American, to take on the messy subject of <br>France and its war. I mumbled something about old ties to the <br>country, and the conversation moved on, away from the particular <br>subjects that had brought me back. She began talking about a mutual <br>acquaintance in the town, a bluff, friendly man with whom I had <br>cordial relations. The woman began talking about his parents. She <br>slyly suggested that their role during the Occupation had been less <br>than honorable. She said their relations with the Germans had been <br>perhaps a little too close. The woman did not make this observation <br>because she was a student of history. In fact, as a subject of <br>reflection, she couldn"t have been less interested in the period of <br>the war.<br> She made the remark to cast discredit on the man"s parents <br>and, by association, the man himself. Something about this gambit was <br>familiar to me. It was unpleasant enough -- I was fond of the person <br>in question -- to make me think about it afterward, and familiar <br>enough not to have surprised me at all. It had that deep familiarity <br>of something that may have been implanted a long time ago, a way of <br>thinking I might have lived with half consciously for years. The <br>woman was reaching back into a past that was, in some sense, still <br>alive for her, even though she professed disdain for its more <br>everyday manifestations -- for instance, the books about the war and <br>the Occupation that crowded bookstore shelves, even in Vichy.<br> A recurring story about France in the American press over the <br>last several decades was that memories of the Occupation had <br>unexpectedly come back to haunt the country. Whenever scandalous <br>revelations surfaced about the half-hidden wartime record of some <br>official, the point would be made: France was newly haunted by its <br>past. This seemed to me unprovable, inasmuch as it <br>concerned "France." I met many people there who appeared genuinely <br>indifferent to what had happened a half-century before and whose <br>lives showed no sign of being influenced by it.<br> Yet it also seemed clear, just on the surface, that in <br>certain times and places, this phenomenon of being concerned with the <br>past, sometimes to the point of obsession, did exist. The mere fact <br>that old men, some of them quite respectable, were being accused of <br>misdeeds long afterward appeared to be evidence. Clearly, some long-<br>finished events still had the power to move people, or infuriate them.<br> The notion of a continuing past couldn"t have seemed <br>ridiculous to me. Early on, there had been the story of Dr. Martel, <br>and later, awareness of the recent Jewish past. This sequence was not <br>coincidental. Discussions about the Holocaust were infrequent in my <br>family. My father, a secularized Jew from the Upper West Side of New <br>York City, was nineteen when the war ended. He turned to the study of <br>economics, a tool to remake the world, and toyed with the idea of <br>joining Israel"s fight for independence. Unqualified admiration for <br>the Israelis didn"t survive reporting trips to the Middle East, but <br>he was more likely to be preoccupied by their struggles than by, say, <br>the Warsaw Ghetto (though, as a young reporter in 1954, he wrote <br>movingly about a pair of ghetto survivors who had settled in New <br>York.)6 I told him once that I had been reading Primo Levi. "Who is <br>that?" he asked. The Holocaust museum project in Washington, D.C., <br>disturbed him -- evidence of morbid obsession, or so he thought. It <br>wasn"t that he was uninterested in what had happened to the Jews; far <br>from it. But it was not a subject of continuing interrogation. It <br>seemed more important to understand the world from outside that prism.<br> This imperative didn"t apply to me. The Holocaust imposes <br>itself, its shock waves felt all the more strongly in my generation"s <br>adulthood for having been muted earlier on. These reverberations made <br>the shiftings in public consciousness that had occurred in France <br>easier to comprehend for someone like me, born long after the war. <br>Indeed, the phenomenon of a previously half-acknowledged, now <br>renascent history was not unfamiliar.<br> If the past had resurfaced for the French, it had done so <br>largely through the portal of the Jewish experience. The wartime <br>crime for which President Jacques Chirac accepted national <br>responsibility, in his landmark speech of 1995, was the persecution <br>of the Jews and not, say, French assistance to the Germans on the <br>eastern front. The reasons were bound up with the complicated <br>reckoning that had taken place in the country, itself related to the <br>larger, international change of perspective on the continuing <br>significance of the Holocaust.<br> In the years after the war, certain facts had not been dwelt <br>on -- ...</p><h2>Dunmore&#39;s New World: The Extraordinary Life of a Royal Governor in Revolutionary America--with Jacobites, Counterfeiters, Land Schemes, Shipwrecks, ... Royal Weddings (Early American Histories)</h2><p><p></p><p> <i>Dunmore's New World</i> tells the stranger-than-fiction story of Lord Dunmore, the last royal governor of Virginia, whose long-neglected life boasts a measure of scandal and intrigue rare in the annals of the colonial world. Dunmore not only issued the first formal proclamation of emancipation in American history; he also undertook an unauthorized Indian war in the Ohio Valley, now known as Dunmore&#x2019;s War, that was instrumental in opening the Kentucky country to white settlement. In this entertaining biography, James Corbett David brings together a rich cast of characters as he follows Dunmore on his perilous path through the Atlantic world from 1745 to 1809.</p><p>Dunmore was a Scots aristocrat who, even with a family history of treason, managed to obtain a commission in the British army, a seat in the House of Lords, and three executive appointments in the American colonies. He was an unusual figure, deeply invested in the imperial system but quick to break with convention. Despite his 1775 proclamation promising freedom to slaves of Virginia rebels, Dunmore was himself a slaveholder at a time when the African slave trade was facing tremendous popular opposition in Great Britain. He also supported his daughter throughout the scandal that followed her secret, illegal marriage to the youngest son of George III&#x2015;a relationship that produced two illegitimate children, both first cousins of Queen Victoria.</p> <p>Within this single narrative, Dunmore interacts with Jacobites, slaves, land speculators, frontiersmen, Scots merchants, poor white fishermen, the French, the Spanish, Shawnees, Creeks, patriots, loyalists, princes, kings, and a host of others. This history captures the vibrant diversity of the political universe that Dunmore inhabited alongside the likes of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. A transgressive imperialist, Dunmore had an astounding career that charts the boundaries of what was possible in the Atlantic world in the Age of Revolution.</p><p></p></p><p><p>James Corbett David received a Ph.D. in history from the College of William and Mary.

Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello, author of <i>The Men Who Lost America: British Leadership, the American Revolution, and the Fate of the Empire</i>)<br><br><p>In this telling, Dunmore is no drunken fool who lost an empire nor a great emancipator. He is a man of empire, creating and caught by webs of patronage, ambition, and family. David&#x2019;s deep familiarity with the historiographies of the British Empire, the American Revolution, Native America, slavery, and the family makes the book cutting-edge scholarship. His vivid writing and well-crafted plotting make it a page-turner.</p> (<i>William &amp; Mary Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>When John Murray, the Earl of Dunmore, was named royal governor of Virginia in 1771, America&#x2019;s revolutionary spirit was evolving from flicker to flame....

His scriptural learning and realization were equal to those of the famous saints who graced the land of India, and true to his words of advice, his was a disciplined life spent in forest and mountain hermitages. Longchenpa's Thirty Words of Advice are like nuggets of gold offered to us in his open hand so that their inspiration can turn our mind to a sincere and uncorrupted spiritual practice.<br> <p>With his clear introduction to the principles and practice of Dzogchen, Ch�gyal Namkhai Norbu sets in context the thirty words of advice and then proceeds to explain each one as the basis of Longchenpa's spiritual experience, in a way that is relevant to us as individuals in our time.</p></p><p><b>Ch�gyal Namkhai Norbu</b> is a foremost representative of Tibetan culture on the present world scene. Born in Eastern Tibet in 1938, at the age of two he was recognized as a reincarnation of Adzom Drugpa, a renowned Master of the Dzogchen tradition. Still an adolescent, he completed the stages of the rigorous traditional studies, both secular and religious, and received teachings from some of the greatest masters of his time.<br> <p>In 1960 he was invited to Italy by Professor Giuseppe Tucci, a leading figure in early Italian Tibetological studies, to collaborate with the ISMEO (Institute for Studies of the Middle and Extreme Orient) in Rome. From 1962 to 1992 he taught Tibetan and Mongolian language and literature at the Institute for Oriental Studies of the the University of Naples, and became known among scholars for his vast knowledge of the ancient history and literature of Tibet. In the mid seventies Ch�gyal Namkhai Norbu began transmitting the Dzogchen teaching, of which he is considered one of the most important living masters. In 1981 he founded the International Dzogchen Community, a wolrdwide association of people interested in the knowledge and practice of this ancient spiritual path. In 1988 he founded A.S.I.A (Association for Solidarity in Asia), a non governmental organization which implements projects of cooperation and solidarity in Tibet as well as in other troubled regions of the world. In 1991, in the presence of H.H. the XIV Dalai Lama, at Merigar, the seat of the Dzogchen Community in Italy, he founded the Shang Shung International Institute for Tibetan Studies, whose aim is to preserve Tibetan culture in its manifold forms.<br> </p><p>For the last thirty years Ch�gyal Namkhai Norbu has been constantly teaching, responding to invitations to give lectures and lead retreats from all over the world.

She is the author of the short story collection </em>St. Lucy&#x2019;s Home for Girls Raised by Wolves<em> and the novel </em>Swamplandia!<em>, one of the </em>New York Times Book Review&#x2019;s Ten Best Books of 2011. <p>Fans of Tania James's sensational debut novel, <em>Atlas of Unknowns</em>, already know her to be a writer with the panoramic scope and liveliness of Charles Dickens, the sure-footed lyricism and emotional precision of Jhumpa Lahiri, the rocketship ebullience of Junot Diaz, and a voice and vision that are inimitably her own. Now those of us who have been eagerly awaiting James's story collection have a reason to celebrate&#x2014;<em>Aerogrammes</em> is sensational. After reading <em>Atlas</em>, I became a James evangelist, raving to friends that she was a natural-born novelist, her gifts perfectly adapted to the large canvas of the novel. Now, with <em>Aerogrammes</em>, Tania James reveals that she is a master of the short story; I felt that I learned so much about craft by reading <em>Aerogrammes</em>. Each of these nine extraordinary stories is expertly structured, moving inexorably towards conclusions that feel both surprising and true. By turns ebullient and poignant, pinwheeling and wise, they are always devastatingly candid when it comes to their central preoccupations: exile and identity, the faultlines inside a family, grief and love. James's prose sparkles on the sentence level, her imagery pulsing with color and surprise (&#x201c;Chilean flamingoes with their knotted knees&#x201d;). Her first sentences are masterpieces in miniature, and you can feel the storyteller's pleasure that hums through every line of the collection. From &#x201c;Ethnic Ken&#x201d;: &#x201c;My grandfather believed that the guest bathroom drain was a portal for time travel.&#x201d; From &#x201c;Girl Marries Ghost&#x201d;: &#x201c;That year, thousands entered the lottery for only a handful of husbands.&#x201d;</p> <p>What I most admire about<em> Aerogrammes</em> is James's commitment to making her stories both comic and consequential&#x2014;the humor always underscores some powerful insights into her characters' innermost natures. She is such a generous writer, deeply sympathetic to her characters' yearnings, a compassionate chronicle of even their craziest schemes and their stillborn ambitions (Mr. Panicker waits in vain for his son to visit him in "Aerogrammes"; Minal Auntie scrubs at her dark face and dreams of a paler alter ego dancing in the glow of a huge trophy in "Light and Luminous"). James lets us laugh at her protagonists' predicaments without ever making them the butt of the joke. Equally at ease in the first and third-person points of view, James creates characters who are wonderfully particular&#x2014;I especially loved the widower who assuages his grief by burying roadkill, and Minal Auntie, a middle-aged dancing teacher who blames her students for her failure to ascend the Everest of the India Day competition (&#x201c;Pinky, when you call to Krishna, don't make that sexy face&#x201d;). But while the characters of <em>Aerogrammes</em> felt wholly original, the collection's themes are universal. These stories explore homesickness in all of its varieties: that of men and women who leave their birth countries, of children who outgrow their parents, of grandparents who outlive their usefulness to their children, of haunted people separated from their loved ones by oceans and decades, shipwrecked in the present to read the tea leaves of letters and photographs, brittle memories (one son, on trying to analyze his father's handwriting: "The rest of the letter is in Malayalam, and thus illegible to me"; a woman who returns to visit her chimpanzee "brother" struggles to recover their wordless language).</p> <p>I was awestruck by <em>Aerogrammes</em>, scenes of which have stayed with me with the vibrancy of my own memories thanks to the potency of James's prose. I would recommend this collection to anyone looking for proof that the short story is joyfully, promiscuously, thrillingly alive.</p> <p></p><b>Tania James </b>is the author of the novel <i>Atlas of Unknowns. </i>Her fiction has appeared in <i>Boston Review, Granta, One Story, A Public Space, </i>and <i>The Kenyon Review</i>.&nbsp; She lives in Washington, D.C.</p><h2>Gardener&#39;s Magic and Other Old Wives&#39; Lore</h2><p>Gardener&#39;s Magic and Other Old Wives&#39; Lore is the companion volume to the much loved Old Wives&#39; Lore for Gardeners.

Welcome to the cursed town of Sparrow... Two centuries ago, in the small, isolated town, three sisters were sentenced to death for witchery. Stones were tied to their ankles and they were drowned in the deep waters surrounding the town. Now, for a brief time each summer, the sisters return from the depths, stealing the bodies of three weak-hearted girls so that they may seek their revenge, luring boys into the harbor and pulling them down to their watery deaths. Like many locals, seventeen-year-old Penny Talbot has accepted the fate of the town. But this year, on the eve of the sisters&#x2019; return, a boy named Bo Carter arrives; unaware of the danger he has just stumbled into or the fact that his arrival will change everything... Mistrust and lies spread quickly through the salty, rain-soaked streets. The townspeople turn against one another. Penny and Bo suspect each other of hiding secrets. And death comes swiftly to those who cannot resist the call of the sisters. But only Penny sees what others cannot.

She is wispy and angelic, with thin lips pinched tightly together, holding her breath against the icy water. Several men stand in front of the glass tank, staring at her as if she were real. So easily fooled by the spectacle.<br> <br>I think of this photograph every spring, when murmurs begin to circulate through the town of Sparrow about the three sisters who were drowned beyond the maw of the harbor, past Lumiere Island, where I live with my mother. I imagine the three sisters floating like delicate ghosts in the dark shadows beneath the water&#x2019;s surface, mercurial and preserved just like the sideshow mermaid. Did they struggle to stay above the waterline two centuries ago, when they were forced into the deep, or did they let the weight of each stone carry them swiftly to the cold, rocky bottom of the Pacific?&#x2019;<br> <br>A morning fog, somber and damp, slides over the surface of the ocean between Lumiere Island and the town of Sparrow. The water is calm as I walk down to the dock and begin untying the skiff&#x2014;a flat-bottomed boat with two bench seats and an outboard motor. It&#x2019;s not ideal for maneuvering in storms or gales but fine as a runner into town and back. Otis and Olga, two orange tabby cats who mysteriously appeared on the island as kittens two years back, have followed me down to the water, mewing behind me as if lamenting my departure. I leave every morning at this time, motoring across the bay before the bell rings for first period&#x2014;Global Economics class, a subject that I will never use&#x2014;and every morning they follow me to the dock.<br> <br>The intermittent beam of light from the lighthouse sweeps over the island, and for a moment it brushes across a silhouette standing on the rocky western shore atop the cliff: my mother. Her arms are crossed in her knobby camel-colored sweater wrapped tightly around her fragile torso, and she&#x2019;s staring out at the vast Pacific like she does each morning, waiting for someone who will never return: my father.<br> <br>Olga rubs up against my jeans, arching her bony back and raising her tail, coaxing me to pick her up, but I don&#x2019;t have time. I pull the hood of my navy-blue rain slicker up over my head, step into the boat, and yank the cord on the motor until it sputters to life, then steer the boat out into the fog. I can&#x2019;t see the shore or the town of Sparrow through the dim layer of moisture, but I know it&#x2019;s there.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Tall, sawtooth masts rise up like swords from the water, land mines, shipwrecks of years past. If you didn&#x2019;t know your way, you could run your boat into any of the half-dozen wrecks still haunting these waters. Beneath me lies a web of barnacle-crusted metal, links of rusted chain trailing over broken bows, and fish making their homes in rotted portholes, the rigging long since eaten away by the salty water. It&#x2019;s a graveyard of ships. But like the local fishermen chugging out through the dreary fume into the open sea, I can navigate the bay with my eyes pinched shut against the cold. The water is deep here. Massive ships used to bring in supplies through this port, but not anymore. Now only small fishing boats and tourist barges sputter through. These waters are haunted, the seamen still say&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re right.<br> <br>The skiff bumps against the side of dock eleven, slip number four, where I park the boat while I&#x2019;m in class. Most seventeen-year-olds have driver&#x2019;s licenses and rusted-out cars they found on Craigslist or that were handed down from older siblings. But instead, I have a boat. And no use for a car.<br> <br>I sling my canvas bag over my shoulder, weighted down with textbooks, and jog up the gray, slick streets to Sparrow High School. The town of Sparrow was built where two ridges come together&#x2014;tucked between the sea and mountains&#x2014;making mudslides all too common here. One day it will likely be washed away completely. It will be pushed down into the water and buried beneath forty feet of rain and silt. There are no fast-food chains in Sparrow, no shopping malls or movie theaters, no Starbucks&#x2014;although we do have a drive-through coffee hut. Our small town is sheltered from the outside world, trapped in time. We have a whopping total population of two thousand and twenty-four. But that number increases greatly every year on June first, when the tourists converge into town and overtake everything.<br> <br>Rose is standing on the sloping front lawn of Sparrow High, typing on her cell phone. Her wild cinnamon-red hair springs from her head in unruly curls that she loathes. But I&#x2019;ve always envied the lively way her hair cannot be tamed or tied up or pinned down, while my straight, nut-brown hair cannot be coaxed into any sort of bouncy, cheerful configuration&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve tried. But stick-straight hair is just stick-straight hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not ditching me tonight, are you?&#x201d; she asks when she sees me, tenting both eyebrows and dropping her cell into her once-white book bag that&#x2019;s been scribbled with Sharpie and colored markers so that it&#x2019;s now a collage of swirling midnight blues and grassy greens and bubblegum pinks&#x2014;colorful graffiti art that has left no space untouched. Rose wants to be an artist&#x2014;Rose is an artist. She&#x2019;s determined to move to Seattle and attend the Art Institute when we graduate. And she reminds me almost weekly of the fact that she doesn&#x2019;t want to go alone and I should come with her and be her roommate. To which I&#x2019;ve skillfully avoided committing since freshmen year.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t want to escape this rainy, dreadful town, because I do. But I feel trapped, a weight of responsibility settled firmly over me. I can&#x2019;t leave my mother all alone on the island. I&#x2019;m all she has left&#x2014;the only thing still grounding her to reality. And perhaps it&#x2019;s foolish&#x2014;naive even&#x2014;but I also have hope that perhaps my father will return someday. He&#x2019;ll magically appear on the dock and stroll up to the house as if no time has passed. And I need to be here in case he does.<br> <br>But as our junior year comes to an end and our senior year approaches, I&#x2019;m forced to consider the rest of my life and the reality that my future might be right here in Sparrow. I might never leave this place. I might be stuck.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ll stay on the island, reading fortunes from the smeared remains of tea leaves in white porcelain cups just like my mom used to before Dad vanished and never came back. Locals would steer their boats across the harbor, sometimes in secret under a ghost moon, sometimes in the middle of the day because they had an urgent question they needed answered, and they&#x2019;d sit in our kitchen, fingers tapping on the wood-block table, waiting for Mom to tell them their fate. And afterward they&#x2019;d leave folded or crumpled or flattened bills on the table just before they left. Mom would slide the money into a flour tin she kept on the shelf next to the stove. And maybe this is the life I&#x2019;m destined for: sitting at the kitchen table, the sweet scent of chamomile or orange lavender tea settling into my hair, running my finger around the rim of a mug and finding messages in the swirling chaos of leaves.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve glimpsed my own future in those leaves many times: a boy blowing in from across the sea, shipwrecked on the island. His heart beating wildly in his chest, his skin made of sand and wind. And my heart unable to resist. It&#x2019;s the same future I&#x2019;ve seen in every cup of tea since I was five, when my mom first taught me to decipher leaves. Your fate lies at the bottom of a teacup, she had often whispered to me before shooing me off to bed. And the idea of this future stirs inside me whenever I think about leaving Sparrow&#x2014;like the island is drawing me back, my fate rooted here.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not ditching if I never said I&#x2019;d go,&#x201d; I say in response to Rose&#x2019;s question.<br> <br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t allow you to miss another Swan party.&#x201d; She shifts her hips to the side, looping her right thumb around the strap of her book bag. &#x201c;Last year I was stuck talking to Hannah Potts until sunrise, and I won&#x2019;t do it again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll think about it,&#x201d; I say. The Swan party has always served a double purpose: the start of the Swan season and also the end-of-the-school-year bash. It&#x2019;s a booze-fueled celebration that is an odd mix of excitement to be free of classes and teachers and pop quizzes, blended with the approaching dread of the Swan season. Typically, people get way too smashed and no one remembers any of it.<br> <br>&#x201c;No thinking, just doing. When you think about things too long, you just talk yourself out of them.&#x201d; She&#x2019;s right. I wish I wanted to go&#x2014;I wish I cared about parties on the beach. But I&#x2019;ve never felt comfortable at things like this. I&#x2019;m the girl who lives on Lumiere Island, whose mom went mad and dad went missing, who never hangs out in town after school. Who would rather spend her evening reading tide charts and watching boats chug into port than chugging beers with people I barely know.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even have to dress up if you don&#x2019;t want to,&#x201d; she adds. Dressing up was never an option anyway. Unlike most locals in Sparrow, who keep a standby early 1800s costume tucked away in the back of their closet in preparation for the yearly Swan party, I do not.<br> <br>The warning bell for first period rings, and we follow the parade of students through the main front doors. The hallway smells like floor wax and rotting wood. The windows are single-pane and drafty, the wind rattling the glass in the frames every afternoon. The light fixtures blink and buzz. None of the lockers close because the foundation has shifted several degrees off center. If I had known another town, another high school, I might find this place depressing. But instead, the rain that leaks through the roof and drips onto desks and hallway floors during winter storms just feels familiar. Like home.<br> <br>Rose and I don&#x2019;t have first period together, so we walk to the end of A Hall, then pause beside the girls&#x2019; bathroom before we part ways.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;ll tell my mom,&#x201d; I say, scratching at a remnant of Blueberry Blitz nail polish on my left thumb that Rose made me paint on two weeks back at her house during one of our movie nights&#x2014;when she decided that to fit in as a serious art major in Seattle she needed to watch classic Alfred Hitchcock movies. As if scary black-and-white films would somehow anoint her as a serious artist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her you&#x2019;re going to a party&#x2014;that you actually have a life. Or just sneak out. She probably won&#x2019;t even notice you&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>I bite the side of my lip and stop picking at my nail. The truth is, leaving my mom alone for even one night makes me uneasy. What if she woke up in the middle of the night and realized I was no longer asleep in my bed? Would she think I had disappeared just like my dad? Would she go looking for me? Would she do something reckless and stupid?<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s stuck on that island anyway,&#x201d; Rose adds. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s she going to go? It&#x2019;s not like she&#x2019;s just going to walk out into the ocean.&#x201d; She pauses and we both stare at each other: Her walking out into the ocean is precisely what I&#x2019;m afraid of. &#x201c;What I mean,&#x201d; Rose corrects, &#x201c;is that I don&#x2019;t think anything will happen if you leave her for one night. And you&#x2019;ll be back right after sunrise.&#x201d;<br> <br>I look across the hall to the open doorway of my first-period Global Economics class, where nearly everyone is already in their seats. Mr. Gratton is standing at his desk, tapping a pen on a stack of papers, waiting for the final bell to ring.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Rose begs. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the biggest night of the year, and I don&#x2019;t want to be the loser who goes solo again.&#x201d; A slight lisp trails over the word &#x201c;solo.&#x201d; When Rose was younger, she talked with a lisp. All her Ss sounded like Ths. In grade school, kids used to tease her whenever a teacher asked her to speak out loud in front of the class. But after regular visits to a speech therapist up in Newport three days a week during our first years of high school, suddenly it was like she stepped out of her old body and into a new one. My awkward, lisping best friend was now reborn: confident and fearless. And even though her appearance didn&#x2019;t really change, she now radiated like some beautiful exotic species of human that I didn&#x2019;t recognize, while I stayed exactly the same. I have this sense that someday we won&#x2019;t even remember why we were friends in the first place. She will float away like a brightly colored bird living in the wrong part of the world, and I will stay behind, gray-feathered and sodden and wingless.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I relent, knowing that if I skip another Swan party she might actually disown me as her only friend.<br> <br>She grins widely. &#x201c;Thank God. I thought I was going to have to kidnap you and drag you there.&#x201d; She shifts her book bag higher onto her shoulder and says, &#x201c;See you after class.&#x201d; She hurries down the hall just as the final bell chimes from the tinny overhead speakers.<br> <br>Today is only a half day: first and second period, because today is also the last day of school before summer break. Tomorrow is June first. And although most high schools don&#x2019;t start their summer session so early, the town of Sparrow began the countdown months ago. Signs announcing festivals in honor of the Swan sisters have already been hung and draped across the town square and over storefront windows.<br> <br>Tourist season starts tomorrow. And with it comes an influx of outsiders and the beginning of an eerie and deadly tradition that has plagued Sparrow since 1823&#x2014;ever since the three Swan sisters were drowned in our harbor. Tonight&#x2019;s party is the start of a season that will bring more than just tourist dollars&#x2014;it will bring folklore and speculation and doubt about the town&#x2019;s history. But always, every year without fail or falter, it also brings death.</p><h2>Leica: The First Sixty Years</h2><p>Author Gianni Rogliatti, with additional text and English editing by Dennis Laney. First edition published by Hove Photo Books in 1985 224 pages, hardcover</p><p></p><h2>The Adventures of Ulysses: Illustrated</h2><p>The agents in this tale, besides men and women, are giants, enchanters, sirens: things which denote external force or internal temptations, the twofold danger which a wise fortitude must expect to encounter in its course through this world. The fictions contained in it will be found to comprehend some of the most admired inventions of Grecian mythology. The ground-work of the story is as old as the Odyssey, but the moral and the colouring are comparatively modern. Charles Lamb wrote this small book in 1808 to tell the tale of Homer&#39;s Odyssey to children. It is a wonderfully well-written and accurate account of the story of Ulysses, and modern readers will be surprised at the sentence structure that the early nineteenth century felt was suitable for children. Today it is a good introduction to the verse version for adults as well as children. The year before Lamb wrote this book, he and his sister Mary wrote Tales from Shakespeare in 1807. By avoiding the prolixity which marks the speeches and the descriptions in Homer, I have gained a rapidity to the narration, which I hope will make it more attractive, and give it more the air of a romance to young readers; though I am sensible that by the curtailment I have sacrificed in many places the manners to the passion, the subordinate characteristics to the essential interest of the story. The attempt is not to be considered as seeking a comparison with any of the direct translations of the Odyssey, either in prose or verse, though if I were to state the obligations which I have had to one obsolete version. I should have run the hazard of depriving myself of the very slender degree of reputation which I could hope to acquire from a trifle like the present undertaking.</p><p>Charles Lamb (10 February 1775 &#x2013; 27 December 1834) was an English writer and essayist, best known for his Essays of Elia and for the children's book Tales from Shakespeare, which he produced with his sister, Mary Lamb. Both Charles and his sister Mary suffered from mental illness. As he himself confessed in a letter, Charles spent six weeks in a mental facility during 1795, at the time while he was already making his name as a poet. However, Mary Lamb's illness was particularly strongest. On 22 September 1796, while preparing dinner, Mary became angry with her apprentice, roughly shoving the little girl out of her way and pushing her into another room. Her mother, Elizabeth, began yelling at her for this, and Mary suffered a mental break-down as her mother continued yelling at her. A terrible event occurred: she took the kitchen knife she had been holding, unsheathed it, and stabbed her mother in the heart. Charles ran into the house soon after the murder and took the knife out of Mary's hand. After this incident, he had her placed in a mental institution.</p><h2>Readings in the Philosophy of Science</h2><p>.Hardback,Ex-Library,with usual stamps markings, ,in very good all-round condition,no dust jacket,811pages.</p><p></p><h2>Joan Crawford: The Last Word</h2><p>Reassesses the life and career of Joan Crawford, describes her complex personality, and looks at her major film roles</p><p></p><h2>Editor&#39;s Choice: Literature and Graphics from the U.S. Small Press, 1965-1977</h2><p>Poetry, short stories, essays and art selected from nominations made by editors of small independent and university presses and magazines.</p><p>Invigorating, outrageous, true work by artists who don't fit the establishment mold. --The Washington Post<br><br>Highly recommended.

He did his compulsory year&#39;s military service in the Danish forces in 1936 and then, facing unemployment, joined the German army. He served throughout World War II on all fronts except North Africa. When the war ended in 1945 he was transferred between Russian, American and French prison camps, and upon returning to Denmark, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for treason.

The brief text (11 sentences) is expanded upon by Hughes's warm, detailed illustrations, which are rendered in colored pencils, watercolor, and pen line.

People familiar with his earlier work will recognize the pattern: children set out on an adventure (this one off the coast of Scotland) with a minimum of parental advice and interference.

In comical folk-art paintings, bathed in truly delicious colors, we meet Ed. "Introducing Ed, / with cherries on his head. / He says, 'I like the color,' / So all his stuff is red..." One odd hamlet is described like this: "Clementown is greenish, / the people tall and leanish, / the dogs bark very loudish, / but not because they're meanish." Brown sings the praises of "Snails" as well: "...they don't make threats, / they don't eat meat, / they don't place bets, / they almost always pay their debts / and never puff on cigarettes."

Over the next decade he, like other German Jews, lost his job, his house and many of his friends.Throughout, he remained loyal to his country, determined not to emigrate, and convinced that each successive Nazi act against the Jews must be the last. Saved for much of the war from the Holocaust by his marriage to a gentile, he was able to escape in the aftermath of the Allied bombing of Dresden and survived the remaining months of the war in hiding. Throughout, Klemperer kept a diary. Shocking and moving by turns, it is a remarkable and important document.</p><p>Born in 1881, Victor Klemperer studied in Munich, Geneva and Paris. He was a journalist in Berlin, taught at the University of Naples and received a DSM during WWI as a volunteer in the German army.

One of Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s most valued and independent-minded colleagues, Polzer-Hoditz was born in Prague (then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire) to an aristocratic family with royal connections. Leaving behind his background traditions, he would become a key player in Steiner&#x2019;s regenerative threefold social impulses, working tirelessly for a genuinely unified, free Europe. He also fought to protect Rudolf Steiner&#x2019;s esoteric legacy and the integrity of the Anthroposophical Society. Meyer&#x2019;s book is a pioneering work in biographical literature, structured in four main sections that reflect the stages of an individual&#x2019;s personal development. In the concluding section he studies world events up to the present day, practicing a method referred to as a "symptomatological observation of history," which Polzer-Hoditz himself sought to develop. Much more than a standard biography, Ludwig Polzer-Hoditz presents a vibrantly living picture of how a spiritual individuality can work in human culture and history&#x2015;past, present, and future.</p><p><b>T.

The print, of which numerous multiples were made, shows a monster of a wave rearing up and about to come crashing down on three fishing boats and their crews. One of a monumental series known as &#39;Thirty-six views of Mount Fuji&#39;, Hokusai&#39;s Great Wave - with the graceful snow-clad Mount Fuji on the horizon, unperturbed but wittily dwarfed by the towering strength of the wave that threatens to engulf the struggling boats - has become an iconic image of the power of nature and the relative smallness of man. One of the most famous pieces of Japanese art, this extraordinary artwork has had a huge impact worldwide and has served as a source of inspiration to artists, both past and present. This beautifully illustrated book explores the meaning behind Hokusai&#39;s Great Wave, in the context of the Mount Fuji series and Japanese art as a whole. Taking an intimate look at the Wave&#39;s artistic and historical significance and its influence on popular culture, this concise introduction explains why Hokusai&#39;s modern masterpiece had such an impact after its creation in 1830 and why it continues to fascinate, inspire and challenge today.</p><p>Tim Clark is the head of the Japanese collections at the British Museum.

Donn then tells the stories of the Mets catching the Chicago</p></p><p>Donn Clendenon came up to the Pittsburgh Pirates in September, 1961 and played major league baseball for twelve years with the Pittsburgh Pirates, briefly for the Montreal Expos, the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals. Donn was part of the the middle of the Pirates batting line-up called the Lumber Company which consisted of Donn, Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargel. Donn, Roberto and Willie all were named as the Most Valuable Player in the 1969, 1971, and 1979 World Series, respectively. <p>Donn grew up in Atlanta and received his B.S. from Morehouse College. He later obtained his Juris Doctor from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. </p><p>Donn has three children, Val, Donn, Jr. and Donna. Donn and his wife, Ann, live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota</p>Donn Clendenon was a tower of strength for me. I love the man. He made me feel very capable with his performance and leadership, and when you read his book, you'll understand why. I couldn't put the book down as it evoked wonderful memories for me of that fabulous year. -- <i>Tug McGraw-Relief Pitcher for the 1969 Mets</i><br><br>The 1969 Mets had great pitching, defense, and timley hitting. The team was like a puzzle that was being put together by Gil Hodges, and when Gil acquired Donn Clendenon in June of 1969, he was the final piece of the puzzle that set us in motion to pursue our World Series Championship. -- <i>Tommie Agee--Centerfielder for the 1969 Mets</i><br><br>The 1969 Mets were known for the great pitching of Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Gary Gentry, Nolan Ryan, and Tug McGraw. But until Donn Clendenon showed up with his big bat, we had no chance of winning anything! -- <i>Ron Swoboda-Rightfielder for the 1969 Mets</i><br><br>The Mets really got lucky when Gil Hodges and Johnny Murphy brought Donn Clendenon to New York in Juen of 1969. Although they traded for Donn to help strengthen the Mets against left-handed pitchers, he really helped us in hitting against both left-handed and right-handed pitchers and with his excellen defense. Donn was a great asset to the team because he was a team leader on the field, off the field, and especially in the clubhouse. -- <i>Cleon Jones-Leftfielder for the 1969 Mets</i></p><h2>Creatures: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Wiry, rhythmic, and wrenchingly beautiful,&nbsp;<i>Creatures&nbsp;</i>plumbs the sea-struck heart of a family fractured by longing&nbsp;and grief.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Leni Zumas,&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>Red Clocks</i></b>&nbsp;On the eve of Evangeline&#x2019;s wedding, a dead whale is trapped in the&nbsp;harbor of Winter Island, the groom may be lost at sea, and Evie&#x2019;s&nbsp;mostly absent mother has shown up out of the blue.

It's so physically present you can feel the waves hit your body, smell the sea life, hear the roar of the ocean as your hair whips around your face in the breeze. Crissy Van Meter has written a book about the complexities of love and families, yes, but it's also a careful look at intimacy through the lens of a person learning and relearning how to love the people who continually let us down.

The haunting yet nostalgic subject matter married with the captivating prose result in a highly original and personal work by the author of Kaputt and La Pelle. Malaparte published Donna Come Me (Woman Like Me) in 1940, introducing it with a quote from Lautr�amont, thus strengthening the link between his work and that of the literary father of the French Surrealists. Four years prior to Donna Come Me, Malaparte published a book of short stories entitled Fughe in Prigione (Escapes in Prison). The title of the book Fughe in Prigione as opposed to Fuga dalla Prigione presents Malaparte&#39;s short stories as forms of mental escape, suggesting that one can imprison the body but the mind of a writer cannot be restrained. In Woman Like Me the short story format finds a more autobiographical thread, the Like Me suffix linking together disparate times and loves in Malaparte&#39;s life, a reassertion and reassembly of his carefully constructed identity in literary format. Woman Like Me&#39;s short stories are a part-real part-fictional account of Malaparte&#39;s memories, dreams and desires. The overwhelming presence of the natural world seems to act as a mirror that reflect his states of mind, and is the element that links the captivating prose of the book and the choice of location his notorious house, the Casa Malaparte in Capri. In the short stories of Woman Like Me, Malaparte invites the reader into his own private prison by the sea, into his own solitude amidst the Mediterranean landscape.</p><p></p><h2>The Winter War in the Air Red Stars Volume 7 Hardcover Carl-Fredrik Geust Apali</h2><p>This is Red Stars vol. 7 - talvisota ilmassa - The Winter War in the Air, by noted military and aviation historian Carl-Fredrik Geust.

His book <i>President Washington's War </i>was nominated for the Pulitzer, Parkman, Bancroft, and Western Heritage prizes. He lives in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.</p>No serious analysis of the battles around and in Chattanooga would be complete without an in-depth look at the personalities that formed their outcome. The author (Embrace an Angry Wind: The Confederacy's Last Hurrah, LJ 1/92) studies the actions and decisions of generals Rosecrans and Bragg as they approached the Battle of Chickamauga, then follows up through the Siege of Chattanooga with the same type of in-depth look at most of the generals involved in the decisions before the final battle. The outcome depended more upon the determination and abilities of the individual soldier than upon the decisions of the commanding officers. Sword has written an excellent account of the actual battles and skirmishes that culminated with the loss of Chattanooga to the Union Army. He also gives us an insight into the thoughts and deeds of the individual soldier on both sides. Highly recommended for most libraries.<br><i>W.

NOW!"<br><br>FBI Special Agent Evelyn Baine spun the chair in her tiny cubicle, but her boss was already slamming the door to his office.<br><br>She shrugged back into her suit jacket, buttoned it to cover the weapon at her hip and straightened her spine. Dan Moore's tone didn't bother her; the ASAC&#x2014;Special Agent in Charge&#x2014;was always curt with her. In fact, getting called into his office this early was a good thing. It meant she was getting a new case to profile.<br><br>Her anticipation grew as she wove around cubicles in the unmarked office building in Aquia, Virginia, where the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) was housed. This was her favorite time, early in the morning before most agents arrived, before the smell of burned coffee and stale air-conditioning permeated everything, when it was just her and her cases.<br><br>She entered Dan's office and found him settled at his oversize desk. The head of BAU was, as usual, surrounded by an aura of stress that gave his skin a grayish hue and constantly slanted his eyebrows toward his nose. Today, he also looked frazzled.<br><br>"Take a seat." Dan popped three antacids into his mouth and took a swig of coffee. "Ever been to Bakersville?"<br><br>"No, but it's north of here, right? Small and rural?" She leaned forward, ready for another chance to take on one of society's worst predators. Ready for another chance to give someone else the closure she'd never had. "What happened there?"<br><br>Dan frowned, maybe because he hadn't warmed to her in the past year despite her high success rate. Then again, maybe the antacids had gotten stuck in his throat.<br><br>Evelyn didn't need to hear the answer to her question to know there were sleepless nights and more long hours in her future. When police had a problem so terrible they couldn't handle it themselves, they came to BAU. Given the number of profile requests faxed into the office every day, to actually get a profiler assigned meant a police department's problem was both unusual and deadly.<br><br>"Earlier this morning, two murdered women were discovered in the woods," Dan said. "There are a few preliminaries in the file I emailed you, though not much. I took a lot of it over the phone, but I think it's better if you go straight to the crime scene and get the specifics firsthand. Bakersville wants you on-site now."<br><br>"Now? For only two murders?" The question might have sounded insensitive to her a year ago, but she'd been here long enough to understand that time was a commodity BAU agents didn't have. Normally, the police would have to strike out big before BAU swooped in.<br><br>"It's a weird one. The Bakersville police are leading the investigation and they've asked us to consult. Police Chief Caulfield wants a preliminary criminal personality profile immediately."<br><br>Dan turned back to his computer, effectively dismissing her. "If you need help, ask Greg to go with you."<br><br>Evelyn hid her annoyance. A year ago, Greg Ibsen had initiated her into the world of behavioral analysis. But she wasn't a rookie anymore. She didn't need anyone checking her work simply because she was the youngest agent in the office, the one with the least field experience. She'd earned her spot at BAU. And she worked her ass off every day to prove it.<br><br>"Is there anything else?"<br><br>"Just get to work. Bakersville's never seen anything like this. They're not equipped to handle this killer."<br><br>She nodded and stood. "I'm on it." As she left his office, she couldn't stop herself from glancing at the partition near the coffeepot serving as a bulletin board for anything the agents found of interest. Next to an article on a new brain-mapping technique and a list of the Most Wanted, someone had thumb-tacked a sheet with the heading Predator Still at Large. Underneath was a computer-generated sketch of Dan.<br><br>The spot-on sketch had everything from the dome-shaped head that was only bald on top to the thin, pinched lips, but Dan hadn't yet figured out who it was. Evelyn wasn't going to be the one to enlighten him.<br><br>As soon as she was ensconced in her cubicle again, she quickly skimmed through the meager file in her email, then grabbed her briefcase. When she turned around, she almost slammed into Greg.<br><br>He yanked his mug out of her way, sloshing coffee onto his shoes.<br><br>She grimaced. "Sorry, Greg."<br><br>He shrugged, setting his coffee down as he slipped out of his suit coat to reveal his standard dress shirt and some cartoon-character tie. "No worries. I'll spill it on myself later, anyway."<br><br>Greg Ibsen had been at BAU seven years longer than she had, logging thousands more hours profiling complicated cases. Somehow, he was still the most easygoing guy in the office&#x2014;even after he'd gotten stuck training the newbie Dan didn't want.<br><br>Dropping into his chair, he said, "One of these days maybe you could sleep in a little. Stop making everyone else look lazy." The smile in his tone told her he was at least partly kidding.<br><br>Evelyn fiddled with the thin gold band topped with a small diamond&#x2014;once her grandma's&#x2014;that she never took off. If her grandma realized how much time she spent working, she would've told her the same thing Greg often did: to get a hobby.<br><br>But her grandma would have understood why she didn't. She'd been the one to pull Evelyn's life back together when her best friend, Cassie Byers, had been abducted. She was the only one who truly understood Evelyn's drive to find her, even seventeen years later.<br><br>Pushing back memories of the woman who'd raised her and now needed extensive care herself, she peered at Greg around their shared cubicle wall. Unlike her blank one, his was filled with pictures of his wife, Marnie, and their adopted children, Lucy and Josh. "Dan just gave me a new case. I'm heading out the door."<br><br>"Really? What did you get?"<br><br>"Serial killer."<br><br>Greg's eyebrows reached for each other. "Really? And you're going to the site now?"<br><br>Serial killers were what the unit was best known for profiling, but between evaluating terrorist threats and interpreting the behavior of arsonists, bomb-makers and child predators, they didn't always get priority.<br><br>"Dan said it was weird." And considering the cases they dealt with regularly, that was saying a lot.<br><br>"Weird, huh? Tell me about it when you get back."<br><br>"Sure. Dan thinks I should ask for your help, anyway."<br><br>"What? The little lady can't handle the big, scary serial killer alone?" Greg joked. "Didn't you hear that BAU has a no-womenallowed rule?"<br><br>Evelyn wished Dan's attitude didn't bother her. "You know what a rule-breaker I am."<br><br>He snorted, because that was just as much of a joke as her being unfit to work as a profiler. "Good luck with the case."<br><br>"Thanks," she said. But luck had nothing to do with it.<br><br>She'd worked toward this for most of her life and she was a damn good profiler. Whatever the case, however wily the criminal, she'd write a profile that would bring him to justice.<br><br>The Bakersville, Virginia, police station squatted on a bare patch of land. The faded brick building with weathered windows seemed out of place amid the hundred-year-old pine trees bracketing it on three sides. It was off the main road through town, beside a mom-and-pop coffee shop and a neighborhood of starter homes.<br><br>Evelyn slung her briefcase over her shoulder and trudged up the steps into the station. Inside, it was abuzz with uniformed officers. Two had a cuffed prisoner between them, obviously brought in on a drunk and disorderly charge. Others wore nervous, uncertain expressions, probably because of the murders.<br><br>Evelyn walked up to the desk, where a young officer sat. "Evelyn Baine. I'm the criminal investigative analyst. Chief Caulfield is expecting me."<br><br>The officer's gaze shifted over her questioningly, and Evelyn tried not to let it get her hackles up. Bakersville was rural, and despite the diversity surrounding it, almost entirely white.<br><br>With the mocha-colored skin she'd inherited from her Zimbabwean father and the sea-green eyes she'd gotten from her Irish-English mother, she stood out.<br><br>When she added, "I'm with the FBI," the officer's gaze traveled skeptically from her tidy bun, over her well-tailored suit to her sturdy heels, then squinted at the credentials she held up.<br><br>Finally, he nodded and she tucked them back in her pocket, tugging down the hem of her blazer on the side where she wore her gun. The expensive clothes sometimes raised eyebrows, but they helped bolster her self-confidence when she arrived at a crime scene and had to establish credibility immediately.<br><br>"It's this way," the officer told her, leading her through a bullpen packed with cops.<br><br>There were a few civilians, too, most demanding to know about rumors of a killer. One, a heavyset, bearded man, was asking about ViCAP.<br><br>Surprised at the mention of the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, the database the Bureau used to match unsolved cases of violent crime, Evelyn glanced back.<br><br>The blue-eyed civilian was talking to an officer whose uncertain stance and red face labeled him a rookie. "I don't think we do that," the officer said with a shrug.<br><br>Evelyn made a mental note that no one had cross-checked the murders. Most small towns weren't plugged into ViCAP. Once she saw the crime scene, she'd try to determine whether these were the killer's first crimes; if not, she'd access the database herself and see if she could track him before he'd come to Bakersville.<br><br>The officer escorting her knocked on a door marked Police Chief Tanner Caulfield, then left her alone.<br><br>"Come in," a distinctly Southern voice barked.<br><br>The man inside was young for a police chief. When he stood, he looked as if he had more than a foot on her five feet two inches and a past as a high school linebacker without quite enough bulk to make it into college ball.<br><br>Evelyn thrust out her hand. "I'm Evelyn Baine, from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit. I'm here to consult on your murder investigation."<br><br>His thick eyebrows furrowed. He stared at her dainty hand with its short, unpolished nails, then took it carefully, as though he was afraid he'd break it. As he shook her hand, he was also shaking his head. "Sorry. You don't look like an agent."<br><br>"Really?" Evelyn replied, frustrated by the too-common reaction. "What does an agent look like?"<br><br>"Bigger. But yours is a desk job, right?"<br><br>His assumption annoyed her, but a year of consulting with outside law enforcement had shown her the best way to respond. He wasn't going to respect her unless he thought she could hold her own in the field. "I was a field agent for five years before transferring to BAU. I worked violent crime."<br><br>Tanner's eyebrows jerked up, and he studied her a little more closely as he settled in his chair. "You're going to give me a profile of the killer, right? Something that'll tell us how to catch this bastard?"<br><br>"That's right. It's my job to study behavioral evidence the UNSUB doesn't know he left at the crime scene." That was what had always fascinated her about her job&#x2014;turning an unknown subject (UNSUB) into an identified killer from clues he didn't even realize he was leaving behind. "From that, I can tell you how to locate him and how to interrogate him once he's in custody."<br><br>"Okay," Tanner said slowly. "What exactly do you mean by behavioral evidence?"<br><br>"What I find at the crime scene helps me see how he thinks, what he's looking for in his victims, why he kills."<br><br>"Uh-huh." Tanner sounded as if he didn't quite understand profiling, but that didn't matter.<br><br>Because she understood Tanner. Her job wasn't just about profiling the perpetrators. It was also about profiling the people who called her onto their turf. Most of them only came to the FBI if they were desperate, and many of them resented it. She'd learned fast that sizing up whoever was in charge made her job easier.<br><br>Five minutes in Tanner's office was all she needed to figure out that his position was a major source of pride and that he'd felt underqualified <em>before</em> he'd been tested with a serial killer. As long as she was careful with his ego, he'd be eager to listen to her.<br><br>"Let's get started." Energy hummed in Evelyn's veins. Time to nail another predator to the wall. And he'd never see her coming.<br><br>"Do you have the profile for me now?"<br><br>Without knowing anything other than that there'd been two murders? Did Tanner think she was a psychic? "I'm afraid it doesn't work that way."<br><br>"How does it work?"<br><br>"You have cops at the scene? Let's start there. I want to join them."<br><br>Tanner frowned. "It's ugly, Agent Baine."<br><br>Evelyn nodded. As a woman, she got this reaction a lot. "Trust me, I've probably seen worse."<br><br>"Okay." He stood. "I'll take you."<br><br>Evelyn followed him out to a patrol car and, ten minutes later, they were talking to Jack Harris to tell him they'd be joining the other cops on his property.<br><br>"I wanted him to know I was back. We wouldn't want him to think we were trespassing and shoot at us," Tanner told her as they returned to the car.<br><br>Evelyn glanced at the elderly man watching them from his doorway. He looked as if he shouldn't be able to walk without assistance, let alone fire a weapon.<br><br>"Why are we driving? How far into his property are we going?"<br><br>Tanner gunned the engine. "Pretty far."<br><br>He pulled out of the driveway and headed back the way they'd come, then unexpectedly swung left onto a dirt trail. The police car slowed as it bounced over the uneven ground, and branches scratched both sides.<br><br>Finally, he pulled to a stop behind several other patrol cars and the medical examiner's van. The forest seemed to have swallowed them. Tall oak, hickory and pine trees blocked out most of the sun as Evelyn followed Tanner deeper into the woods.<br><br>"Does this area get much traffic?"<br><br>"The woods?" Tanner grunted. "None. Harris has a hundred acres back here and he guards it with his shotgun. He's the one who found the bodies, and only because he thought he spotted someone trespassing."<br><br>"So where you parked, that was the closest place to bring a vehicle to the crime scene?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>"Then the killer knows the area. And he's not looking for attention."<br><br>"He's not?"<br><br>Evelyn had no idea how deep into the woods they were going, but she couldn't hear the cops yet. "He didn't expect these bodies to be found. So he's not looking for press coverage."<br><br>"You might change your mind when you see the bodies," Tanner muttered.<br><br>Evelyn held back her rebuttal. It didn't matter what state the bodies were in, the drop site told its own story. And this one was already telling her they had a killer who liked his privacy, who was careful and even-tempered. Someone who'd be hard to track down<br><br>"There it is," Tanner finally said, pointing.<br><br>Up ahead, crime scene tape had been strung around trees, and cops were working inside it. Two men in black coats with the words <em>Medical Examiner's Office</em> stenciled on the pockets were carrying a gurney.<br><br></p><h2>Mog the Forgetful Cat: 30th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>A special 30th anniversary edition of the debut of Judith Kerr&#39;s Mog stories.

If the protagonist in question is a young African American woman in Paris, following in the footsteps of such well-known black expatriates as Langston Hughes, Josephine Baker, and James Baldwin, it's double jeopardy. And yet in <i>Black Girl in Paris</i>, Shay Youngblood manages to avoid clich�s even as she steers a course straight through them. In the fall of 1986, Eden, 25 years old and anxious "to be the kind of woman who was bold, took chances and had adventures," buys a ticket to Paris and arrives with $200, determined to re-create for herself the life of a bygone era. She finds the requisite cheap and dingy room--in the Latin Quarter, of course--and low-paying job that all American expatriate artistic wannabes from Hughes to Hemingway must have in order to live the dream. She meets a circle of like-minded compatriots, has an affair with a white jazz musician, and all the while keeps her eye on the prize: a meeting with Baldwin himself. What saves this novel from being a retread of all the portraits of artists as young men and women in Paris that have gone before is Youngblood's <i>conscious</i> invocations of Eden's predecessors, of the bohemian lifestyle, of Paris itself. These are not, she suggests, the things themselves, but rather the romantic imaginings of a young woman who has pinned her hopes and ambitions on stories she's read and heard thirdhand. <p> The reality of Eden's Paris soon sets in, however. Terrorists have besieged France; bombs are going off all over the city and the French don't seem quite as welcoming to people of color as they were back in the '30s and '40s. In fact, <i>this</i> Paris is a violent, frightening place: </p><blockquote> Policemen beat to death a twenty-year-old student Malik Oussekine at the end of peaceful student demonstrations. I pray for the safety of my artist friend Malik and the soul of the student who had been murdered. To make the students seem dangerous and deserving of excessive force, the police had stood by looking on encouraging thugs to loot stores and burn cars. </blockquote> But Eden stays on, and everywhere she finds traces of James Baldwin in the recollections of people who have met him. The hope that if she meets him she'll "learn from him some kind of secret about love and life and writing" keeps her going. Memories of the past mix with hopes for the future, until in the novel's denouement, when Eden makes a surprising discovery about herself. <i>Black Girl in Paris</i> is both a loving homage to Shay Youngblood's literary forebears, and a subtle reminder to her contemporaries that while we may learn from the past, we make our own future. <i>--Sheila Bright</i>Shay Youngblood is a playwright and the author of <i>The Big Mama Stories</i> and <i>Soul Kiss</i>.

In his hands he clutches a box he has found there. He is Donald Gregory, a once-respected college professor and serial adulterer, whose last affair has left his career in ruins. She is Beulah Limosneros, one of his students and for a brief time his lover. She had disappeared into Mexico two years earlier, following her obsession with Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, who was born in 1648, entered a convent at age nineteen, and became the greatest poet of her time, only to die of plague in 1695. As a police investigation closes in around Gregory, he examines the box's contents, fearful of incriminating evidence Beulah may have against him&#x2014;translated poems of Sor Juana, a travel journal, research notes on the Spanish conquest of the Americas and the Inquisition, diary entries concerning him, and a strange manuscript about Sor Juana. Based on the life of one of literature's most compelling figures, Paul Anderson's astonishing debut unveils a great poet's withdrawal from the world who at the height of her creative powers signs a vow of contrition in her own blood.</p><p>An epic novel of genius and obsession -- apocalyptic, lyrical and erotically charged. Spanning three centuries and two cultures, Hunger's Brides brings to vivid life the greatest Spanish poet of her time, Sor Juana In�s de la Cruz, and plumbs a mystery that has intrigued writers as diverse as Robert Graves, Diane Ackerman, Eduardo Galeano and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz. Why did a writer of such gifts silence herself? <br> <br>At the time of her death in 1695, Juana In�s de la Cruz was arguably the greatest writer working in any European tongue, yet she had never set foot in Europe. Instead she was born among the descendants of the Aztec empire, in the shadow of the mountain pass Cort�s and his troops descended on their advance to Montezuma's capital. A child prodigy from a barbarous wilderness, her beauty and wit provoked a sensation at the viceregal court in Mexico City. But at the age of nineteen, still a favourite of the court, Juana entered a convent, and from that point her life unfolded between the mystery of her sudden flight from palace to cloister, and the enigma of her final vow of silence, signed in blood. After a quarter-century of graceful, often sensuous poetry, plays and theological argument, Sor Juana chose silence, which she maintained until she died of plague at the age of forty-five. <br> <br>Drawing on chronicles of the conquest and histories of the Inquisition, myth cycles and archeological studies, ancient poetry and early Spanish accounts of blood sacrifice, <b>Hunger's Brides</b> is a mammoth work of inspired historical fiction framed in a contemporary mystery. In the dead of a Calgary winter night, a man escapes from an apartment in which a young woman lies bleeding -- in his arms he clutches a box he has found on her table addressed to him. He is Donald Gregory, a once-respected, now-disgraced, academic. She is Beulah Limosneros, one of his students, and for a brief time his lover. Brilliant, erratic, voracious, she had disappeared two years earlier in Mexico, following the thread of her growing obsession with Sor Juana. Over the ensuing days and weeks, as a police investigation closes in around him, Gregory pieces together the contents of the box she has left him: a poetic journal of her travel in Mexico, diaries, research notes, unposted letters, and a strange manuscript -- part biography, part novel -- on Sor Juana. <br> <br> <b>Hunger's Brides</b> is a dramatic unveiling of three intimate journeys: a man's forced march to self-knowledge, a great poet's withdrawal from the world, and a profane mystic's pilgrimage into modern Mexico, in which the bones of the past constantly poke through a present built on the ruins of the vanquished. <br> <br> <b>Excerpt from <i>Hunger's Brides</i></b> <br> <i>"From the moment I was first illuminated by the light of reason, my inclination toward letters has been so vehement that not even the admonitions of others . . . nor my own meditations have been sufficient to cause me to forswear this natural impulse that God placed in me . . . that inclination exploded in me like gunpowder. . . ." <br>--Sor Juana, in a letter of self-defence written to a bishop in 1691, just before she took a vow of silence</i>Paul Anderson left Canada in his early twenties and spent fifteen years travelling in Asia, studying in Europe, teaching in Latin America, and logging 25,000 miles of coastal and ocean sailing. <b>Hunger&#x2019;s Brides</b>, his first novel, has been a labour of twelve years. In 1996, Alberta&#x2019;s One Yellow Rabbit company toured a dramatic reading adapted from the manuscript by the author, and performed in the convent where Sor Juana died.

This beautiful large-format volume will quickly become a child's cherished favorite.</p><p>Once upon a time in Germany, some 200 years ago, the brothers Grimm began collecting unusual tales from friends, relatives, and a variety of acquaintances. They eventually recorded their stories, which not only found their way across the ocean, but also around the globe. The stories survive to this day as Grimm&#39;s fairy tales, in which wolves, witches, and cruel stepmothers abound. Children get lost in the woods, grandma gets eaten by a wolf, and robbers steal into houses in the dead of night, among other misfortunes. But never fear! Precocious children, beautiful princesses, and enchanted animals prevail in the battle between good and evil. Seven artists provide lively illustrations for the stories included in this treasury of tales.Kindergarten-Grade 3-- Ten of the most familiar Grimm tales, including "Snow White," "Rumplestiltskin," "Rapunzel," and "The Fisherman and His Wife," presented in a handsome format with full-color illustrations by seven different artists. Although the oversized book seems attractive at first glance, closer examination reveals some serious flaws. Egan's retellings are curiously flat, written in dull and unimaginative language. In an attempt to simplify the stories, elements of plot are skimmed over, and a jarring lack of descriptive detail makes the stories seem sketchy and uninvolving. Readers will be left wondering where the magic of the original stories has gone. The illustrations vary considerably in quality and mood. Erin Wise's for "Cinderella" and Karen Pritchett's for "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Hansel and Gretel" are the most successful, far outstripping the watered-down texts. The rest range from saccharine to cartoonish, featuring awkward postures; flat, featureless faces; and undistinguished technique. --Linda Boyles, Alachua County Library District, Gainesville, FL<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jaran (The Jaran, Book 1)</h2><p>Tess had been cursed by an accident of birth, cursed to be the sister of the one man honored by the alien conquerors of human-run space.

From this simple scenario Patrick White unfurls a monumental exploration of the tides of love and hate, comedy and tragedy, impotence and and longing that fester within family relationships.</p><p>Patrick White was born in England in 1912 and taken to Australia, where his father owned a sheep farm, when he was six months old. He was educated in England at Cheltenham college and King&#39;s College, Cambridge. He settled in London, where he wrote several unpublished novels, then served in the RAF during the war. He returned to Australia after the war. He became the most considerable figure in modern Australian literature, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973. The great poet of Australian landscape, he turned its vast empty spaces into great mythic landscapes of the soul. His position as a man of letters was controversial, provoked by his acerbic, unpredictable public statements and his belief that it is eccentric individuals who offer the only hope of salvation. He died in September 1990.Eye of the Storm<br><i>One</i>THE OLD woman's head was barely fretting against the pillow. She could have moaned slightly.'What is it?' asked the nurse, advancing on her out of the shadow. 'Aren't you comfortable, Mrs Hunter?''Not at all. I'm lying on corks. They're hurting me.'The nurse smoothed the kidney-blanket, the macintosh, and stretched the sheet. She worked with an air which was not quite professional detachment, nor yet human tenderness; she was probably something of a ritualist. There was no need to switch on a lamp: a white light had begun spilling through the open window; there was a bloom of moonstones on the dark grove of furniture.'Oh dear, will it never be morning?' Mrs Hunter got her head as well as she could out of the steamy pillows.'It is,' said the nurse; 'can't you -- can't you <i>feel</i> it?' While working around this almost chrysalis in her charge, her veil had grown transparent; on the other hand, the wings of her hair, escaping from beneath the lawn, could not have looked a more solid black.'Yes. I can feel it. It is morning.' The old creature sighed; then the lips, the pale gums opened in the smile of a giant baby. 'Which one are you?' she asked.'De Santis. But I'm sure you know. I'm the night nurse.''Yes. Of course.'Sister de Santis had taken the pillows and was shaking them up, all but one; in spite of this continued support, Mrs Hunter looked pretty flat.'I do hope it's going to be one of my good days,' she said. 'I do want to <i>sound</i> intelligent. And look - presentable.''You will if you want to.' Sister de Santis replaced the pillows. 'I've never known you not rise to an occasion.''My will is sometimes rusty.''Dr Gidley's coming in case. I rang him last night. We must remember to tell Sister Badgery.''The will doesn't depend on doctors.'Though she might have been in agreement, it was one of the remarks Sister de Santis chose not to hear. 'Are you comfortable now, Mrs Hunter?'The old head lay looking almost embalmed against the perfect structure of pillows; below the chin a straight line of sheet was pinning the body to the bed. 'I haven't felt comfortable for years,' said the voice. 'And why do you have to go? Why must I have Badgery?''Because she takes over at morning.'A burst of pigeons' wings was fired from somewhere in the garden below.'I hate Badgery.''You know you don't. She's so kind.''She talks too much - on and on about that husband. She's too bossy.''She's only practical. You have to be in the daytime.' One reason why she herself preferred night duties.'I hate all those other women.' Mrs Hunter had mustered her complete stubbornness this morning. 'It's only you I love, Sister de Santis.' She directed at the nurse that milky stare which at times still seemed to unshutter glimpses of a terrifying mineral blue.Sister de Santis began moving about the room with practised discretion.'At least I can see you this morning,' Mrs Hunter announced. 'You can't escape me. You look like some kind of -- big -- <i>lily</i>.'The nurse could not prevent herself ducking her veil.'Are you listening to me?'Of course she was: these were the moments which refreshed them both.'I can see the window too,' Mrs Hunter meandered. 'And something - a sort of wateriness - oh yes, the looking-glass. Allgood signs! This is one of the days when I can see better. I shall see <i>them</i>!''Yes. You'll see them.' The nurse was arranging the hairbrushes; the ivory brushes with their true-lovers' knots in gold and lapis lazuli had a fascination for her.'The worst thing about love between human beings,' the voice was directed at her from the bed, 'when you're prepared to love them they don't want it; when they do, it's you who can't bear the idea.''You've got an exhausting day ahead,' Sister de Santis warned; 'you'd better not excite yourself.''I've always excited myself if the opportunity arose. I can't stop now - for anyone.'Again there was that moment of splintered sapphires, before the lids, dropping like scales, extinguished it.'You're right, though. I shall need my strength.' The voice began to wheedle. 'Won't you hold my hand a little, dear Mary - isn't it? de Santis?'Sister de Santis hesitated enough to appease the spirit of her training. Then she drew up a little mahogany tabouret upholstered in a faded sage. She settled her opulent breasts, a surprise in an otherwise austere figure, and took the skin and bone of Mrs Hunter's hand.Thus placed they were exquisitely united. According to the light it was neither night nor day. They inhabited a world of trust, to which their bodies and minds were no more than entrance gates. Of course Sister de Santis could not answer truthfully for her patient's mind: so old and erratic, often feeble since the stroke; but there were moments such as this when they seemed to reach a peculiar pitch of empathy. The nurse might have wished to remain clinging to their state of perfection if she had not evolved, in the course of her working life, a belief - no, it was stronger: a religion - of perpetual becoming. Because she was handsome in looks and her bearing suggested authority, those of her colleagues who detected in her something odd and reprehensible would not have dared call it 'religious'; if they laughed at her, it was not to her face. Even so, itcould have been the breath of scorn which had dictated her choice of the night hours in which to patrol the intenser world of her conviction, to practise not only the disciplines of her professed vocation, but the rituals of her secret faith.Then why Mrs Hunter? those less dedicated or more rational might have suggested, and Mary de Santis failed to explain; except that this ruin of an over-indulged and beautiful youth, rustling with fretful spite when not bludgeoning with a brutality only old age is ingenious enough to use, was also a soul about to leave the body it had worn, and already able to emancipate itself so completely from human emotions, it became at times as redemptive as water, as clear as morning light.This actual morning old Mrs Hunter opened her eyes and said to her nurse, 'Where are the dolls?''Where you left them, I expect.' Because her inept answer satisfied neither of them, the nurse developed a pained look.'But that's what they always say! Why don't they bring them?' Mrs Hunter protested.The nurse could only bite her lip; the hand had been dragged away from hers.'Of course you know about the dolls. Don't say I didn't tell you.' The old woman was threatening to become vindictive. 'We were living beside the - oh, some - some <i>geographical</i> river. My father had given me a hundred dolls. Think of it - a hundred! Some of them I didn't look at because they didn't interest me, but some I loved to distraction.'Suddenly Mrs Hunter turned her head with such a doll's jerk Sister de Santis held her breath.'You know it isn't true,' the old child complained. 'It was Kate Nutley had the dolls. She was spoilt. I had two - rather battered ones. And still didn't love them equally.'Sister de Santis was troubled by the complexities of a world she had been forced to re-enter too quickly.'I tore the leg off one,' Mrs Hunter admitted; her recovered calm was enviable.'Didn't they mend it?' the nurse dared inquire.'I can't remember.' Mrs Hunter gave a little whimper. 'And have to remember everything today. People try to catch you out - accuse you - of not - not loving them enough.'She was staring at the increasing light, if not glaring, frightfully.'And look my best. Bring me my looking-glass, Nurse.'Sister de Santis fetched the glass: it was of that same ivory set as the brushes with lovers' knots in gold and lapis lazuli. Holding it by its fluted handle she tilted the glass for her patient to look. The nurse was glad she could not see the reflection: reflections can be worse than faces.Mrs Hunter was panting. 'Somebody must make me up.''Sister Badgery will see to that.''Oh, Badgery! She's awful. If only little Manhood were here - she knows how to do it properly. She's the one I like.''Sister Manhood won't be here till lunch.''Why can't somebody telephone her?''She'll still be asleep. And later she'll probably have some shopping to do.'Mrs Hunter was so upset she let her head drop on the pillow: tears gushed surprisingly out of the half-closed eyes.Sister de Santis heard her own voice sound more placid than she felt. 'If you rest your mind you'll probably look far more beautiful as your natural self. And that is how they'll want to see you.'But the old woman fully closed her eyes. 'Not now. Why, my lashes are gone - my complexion. I can <i>feel</i> the freckles, even on my eyelids, without having to look for them.''I'm sure you're exaggerating, Mrs Hunter.' Small comfort; but the nurse's feet were aching, nor had her mind, her eyes, adjusted themselves to daylight: the withdrawal of darkness had left her puffy and moth-like.When she noticed her patient staring at her too obsessively. 'I'd like you to bring me something to drink. And something else - ' putting out a hand at its oldest and feeblest, 'I want you to forgiveme, Mary. Will you?' stroking no longer with bones, but the tips of feathers.The sensation experienced by Sister de Santis was scarcely sensual; nor did it lift her to that state of disembodiment they sometimes enjoyed together. It was disturbing, though.For her own protection the nurse ignored half the request, while agreeing too heartily to the other. 'All right!

The story, mainly carried on by tedious and often intellectually pretentious dialogue between a profusion of two-dimensional characters, is about the CIA's attempt to foster a right-wing coup against "Nagonia," a Moscow-supported nation in Africa, and the KGB's successful scheme to thwart it. Though an agent or counteragent "disappears" every now and then, there's very little action, surprising in a writer who apparently takes Hemingway as his literary hero. The love interest is virtually nil, and, while ostensibly set in Moscow and Africa, the story captures so little in the way of local atmosphere, it might almost have been set in a parking lot. The KGB agents are basically good guys, as might be expected, the CIA types, backed by "the Military-Industrial Complex," basically ruthless and deceitful, despite their "human" veneer. Semyonov is reputed to be a friend of Gorbachev and a high-up in the KGB; it could just be that his connections are more interesting than his writing.

The 19 essays in this collection focus on each filmmaker&#39;s ability to create a vision that both reveals and redefines our national cultures. Together, these essays, by established and emerging scholars, highlight the diversity, imaginative power, and talent of Canadian filmmakers. This collection&#39;s value is in its contemporary analysis of major figures as well as critical discussions of the work of women directors and young filmmakers. Filmographies and selected bibliographies for each director provide film students and the movie-going public with an unrivalled study of a cinema that now garners world attention.</p><p>George Melnyk is a cultural historian who has published some twenty books in a distinguished career, including works of philosophy, history, politics, and poetry. He teaches in the Faculty of Communication and Culture at the University of Calgary, where he specializes in Canadian cinema."One Saturday in the winter of 1965 I talked my father into driving me to Toronto from our home in Oshawa, Ontario, to see a particular movie that I knew I would never see at the local cinema. I was 14 years old. What I saw that cold night made a profound and lasting impression on me. I grew up watching Hollywood westerns and commercial television shows and, like most people of my generation, I thoughtlessly consumed those products for escape and entertainment. Never before had I seen a film that encouraged me to think about myself, my own life and the province that was my home. The movie was called Nobody Waved Goodbye. It was produced at the National Film Board of Canada and directed by a Torontonian named Don Owen. Thus began my 40-year love affair with Canadian cinema. By becoming a passionate fan of Canadian cinema in the 1960s, I joined a relatively small group of people who go to see Canadian films because it nurtures our souls and provides us with powerful food for thought from a familiar point of view. [F]or the intrepid voluntary viewers out there, this book will be an invaluable resource-a map to navigate their courageous journey through the wonderfully contradictory worlds of our brave film artists and the almost invisible yet burning hearts of those who live on the frosty masthead of the North American continent." Clarke Mackey, Literary Review of Canada, October 2007<br><br>"One of Melnyk's goals is to introduce the work of these directors to a wider audience. 'We make films that very few people see. Probably 80 percent of my students had never seen a Canadian film. These directors make superb films.' But, in the end, it is a very personal thing. 'I want to see Canadian films because they do something for my soul.'" Polly Washburn, Prairie books NOW, Fall/Winter 2007<br><br>"Canadians too often overlook the existence of film directors who have made a major contribution in defining our culture. With Great Canadian Film Directors, George Melnyk has skillfully put together essays on 20 directors by a number of scholars and critics, focusing on their diversity, complexity, imagination and talent. Why directors and not stars? Because our star system is practically non-existent....[T]he list is impressive and worth our scrutiny. Some names may be familiar, other decidedly not. Surprisingly, genders are well represented." Nicholas Spillios, Edmonton Journal, November 25, 2007<br><br>"...We should be grateful that Melnyk has been the facilitator for some excellent essays. The most original pieces include those of Jerry White on Zach Kunuk's career and artistic perspective; Jacqueline Levitin on Mina Shum's difficult but fruitful creative negotiation of her Chinese Canadian status; Patricia Gruben's thoughtful analysis of Gary Burns' work' and Bart Testa's valiant and exceedingly well informed attempt to cut through the misconceptions about Norman Jewison and his films. Students grappling with Canadian cinema for the first time will be grateful for Bill Beard's views on Atom Egoyan; Kay Armatage's feminist take on Nell Shipman and Joyce Wieland's curtailed careers; Pierre Veronneau's masterly overview of Denys Arcand's themes' Brenda Austin-Smith's astute treatment of Patricia Rozema's cinema; and Peter Dickinson's critique of Robert Lepage's oeuvre. Is is also good to see attention given to Lea Pool. ... The sins of omission are endless in any anthology, and I'm sure Melnyk would be the first to admit that another book could be published on a slew of other directors. ... As it stands, the collection contains some original work, many solid introductions, and only a few missed opportunities." Brian McIlroy, Canadian Literature, Summer 2008<br><br>"George Melnyk's aim for his scholarly yet readable Great Canadian Film Directors is to present "a clear understanding of why Canadian directors are so crucial to the development of a distinct cinematic identity, both thematically and aesthetically." To accomplish his purpose, Melnyk, an associate professor of Canadian Studies and Canadian Film Studies at the University of Calgary, and a prolific author, focuses on the films of 20 Canadian directors in 19 essays by respected scholars, some, like the filmmakers themselves, better known than others. The diversity of the presentations is held together by broad categories of identities such as English, French, and Inuit, male and female, and in time frames of "Late Greats," "Contemporary Greats," and "Future Greats" to establish that "the breadth and depth of Canadian cinema is outstanding." In developing his thesis for the diversity and excellence of Canadian film achieved by directors such as Claude Jutra, Norman Jewison, David Cronenberg, Atom Egoyan, Patricia Rozema, immigrant Lea Pool, and Inuit artist and filmmaker Zack Kunuk, Melnyk develops the rationale for his choices and his omissions, and his preference for the adjective "great." His colleagues, in turn, scrutinize the themes and aesthetics of the directors. Kay Armatage, for example, compares the works of Nell Shipman and Joyce Weiland. Christopher Gittings profiles director John Greyson and his "queer aesthetic . [that] broadens our perspective on Canadian cinema." Aaron Taylor analyzes the work of Bruce McDonald, "the 'bad boy' of Canadian Cinema," while Jacqueline Levitin's discourse features Chinese-Canadian Mina Shum's films, and Kalli Paakspuu discusses the necrophilia in Lynne Stopkewich's work. The groundbreaking, award-winning film Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner, by Inuit director Kunuk, is the subject of Jerry White's erudite essay. Although admittedly not the last word on why or who of Canada's film directors have attained or will achieve greatness, Melnyk definitely establishes the diversity and excellence of the "Greats" included in the insightful and interesting essays in his book. Academics, film students, and teachers will find it a rewarding read." - M. Wayne Cunningham</p><h2>After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History</h2><p><p>Over a decade ago, Arthur Danto announced that art ended in the sixties. Ever since this declaration, he has been at the forefront of a radical critique of the nature of art in our time. <i>After the End of Art</i> presents Danto's first full-scale reformulation of his original insight, showing how, with the eclipse of abstract expressionism, art has deviated irrevocably from the narrative course that Vasari helped define for it in the Renaissance. Moreover, he leads the way to a new type of criticism that can help us understand art in a posthistorical age where, for example, an artist can produce a work in the style of Rembrandt to create a visual pun, and where traditional theories cannot explain the difference between Andy Warhol's Brillo Box and the product found in the grocery store. Here we are engaged in a series of insightful and entertaining conversations on the most relevant aesthetic and philosophical issues of art, conducted by an especially acute observer of the art scene today.</p><br><p> Originally delivered as the prestigious Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts, these writings cover art history, pop art, "people's art," the future role of museums, and the critical contributions of Clement Greenberg--who helped make sense of modernism for viewers over two generations ago through an aesthetics-based criticism. Tracing art history from a mimetic tradition (the idea that art was a progressively more adequate representation of reality) through the modern era of manifestos (when art was defined by the artist's philosophy), Danto shows that it wasn't until the invention of Pop art that the historical understanding of the means and ends of art was nullified. Even modernist art, which tried to break with the past by questioning the ways of producing art, hinged on a narrative.</p><br><p> Traditional notions of aesthetics can no longer apply to contemporary art, argues Danto. Instead he focuses on a philosophy of art criticism that can deal with perhaps the most perplexing feature of contemporary art: that everything is possible.</p></p><p>Art is still dead, according to Arthur Danto, professor at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>. <i>After the End of Art: Contemporary Art and the Pale of History</i> is a collection of Danto's 1995 Mellon Lectures on the Fine Arts. Famous for his radical critiques of the nature of art--he dates the death of art to around 1964 and declares the art museum has replaced the church for the masses--Danto continues to question traditional notions of aesthetics and philosophy in regard to contemporary art. While touching on a variety of art-related topics, the focus of tehse lectures remains the deviation of contemporary art from the great narrative that has defined art throughout history.<b>Arthur C. Danto</b>, Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University, is Art Critic for <i>The Nation</i>. His books include <i>The Transfiguration of the Commonplace</i>, <i>Embodied Meanings</i>, <i>Beyond the Brillo Box</i>, and <i>Encounter and Reflections</i>, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Prize in Criticism.</p><h2>The Ballad of Matthew&#39;s Begats: An Unlikely Royal Family Tree</h2><p><p>Who says all those "begats" in the first chapter of Matthew aren't fun to read?

I joined the Air Force immediately after graduating from high school. After completing four years in the Air Force I entered college. I graduated from college in 1963 and spent my professional career as a Ground Water Hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. I became fascinated with the game of pool at a young age bit was not able to get serious about it until after graduating college. To accelerate my learning I read every book ever published (in English) on the subject. Although all the books were interesting they were not very informative. I decided then that someday I would write a book based on factual principals that could be translated to shot making at the table. For the next twenty five years I attended (mostly as an observer) every pro and non pro pool tournament that I could. I took notes at every event, after retiring from my professional career, I used these notes as a bases for my pool books.

Most of his best works feature children and young people solving intriguing puzzles within a solid science framework. In Needle (1949), an alien criminal crash-lands on Earth, closely pursued by a policeman of the same species. The twist is that they're parasitic blobs of jelly, dependent on a host to survive. Iceworld (1953) lacks both a puzzle and youthful protagonists; an alien criminal from a very hot, bright planet perceives Earth as a gloomy, frigid netherworld. The brave young girl and her alien counterpart of Close to Critical (1958) become trapped on the surface of a planet under conditions where phase changes make water unpredictable. Persuasive aliens, remarkable world-building, and splendid puzzles: fans partial to any of these will find Clement well worth investigating. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Her first album, Horses, was a landmark album of power, bravado, beauty, and grace. Its famous cover portrait, photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, "was the first to claim both vision and authority," wrote Camille Paglia. "No female rocker had ever dominated an image in this aggressive, uncompromising way."<br><br>Seven albums later, and a life punctuated by a long hiatus during which Smith raised her two children and suffered the tragic losses of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith, her dear friend, Robert Mapplethorpe, and her beloved brother, Smith is ready to mark her first fifty years on the planet with a book her fans have long awaited: the complete lyrics. With never-before-seen photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Annie Liebovitz, Kate Simon, and others, plus original artwork and text by Smith, <i>Patti Smith Complete</i> is a living commemoration of Smith's unique contribution to music and the empowerment of people through her message of work, love, and charity.</p><p>Patti Smith, pioneering punk diva, has always worshipped at the altar of the word, and she opens this book with a quote from her mentor and friend, the late Allen Ginsberg: "The typewriter is holy the poem is holy the voice is holy the hearers are holy the ecstasy is holy." If that is true, then this volume serves as Smith's <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, containing all the lyrics from her past seven albums, and spanning two and a half decades. She picks out both salient and arcane compositions and annotates them with an unstinting eye for detail and history, allowing us to stand a moment in her flat-heeled karate shoes and see what inspired her to pen these songs. Who among us suspected that 1971's "Redondo Beach," with its grizzly images of loss and suicide, was written about an argument Smith had with her sister? In addition to the thumbnail sketches and the unexpurgated journal entries, Smith has collected more than 150 photographs (some never before published) by the likes of Annie Liebovitz, Robert Mapplethorpe, Michael Stipe, and Linda McCartney. There is one particularly disturbing image of the singer during her painful recovery from a broken back, which she suffered as a result of a stage fall in 1977, proving that there is little that the singer has held back in her effort to communicate who she is to her fans.<p>Why did she go to all the trouble? According to Smith, her fans had been clamoring for her to publish her lyrics for years, but until recently she didn't feel she had a substantial enough body of work. Besides, she claims that she was tired of everyone else deconstructing her songs and publishing what they thought she meant. "And they were always inaccurate," she writes. So, now, Patti Smith is finally able to set the record straight. <i>--Jaan Uhelszki</i></p>"The first great rock'n'roll collection to be published since <b>Dylan's Lyrics: 1962-1985</b>." --<i>Salon</i><br><br>"Her influence in music today is undeniable. There's not anybody I know in a band anywhere who does not revere the records she put out. There was a rawness and energy to <b>Horses</b> that I had not heard in any other music. From then on, my life was changed." --Michael Stipe, R.E.M.<br><br>"Patti Smith is not only a great performer, she is a shaman--that is, someone in touch with other levels of reality." --William S. Burroughs<br></p><h2>Kekkaishi, Vol. 1</h2><p>Follows junior high school student Yoshimori Sumimura and his sixteen-year-old neighbor and childhood friend, Tokine Yukimura, as they battle evil forces in their mission to protect Karasumori forest.</p><p>Born June 13th in Tokyo. Yellow Tanabe&#39;s first manga story &#34;Yami no Naka&#34; (In the Dark) received an honorable mention in Shogakukan publishing&#39;s New Comic Artist competition. Her first published manga Lost Princess debuted in 2002. Kekkaishi first appeared in 2003, in the weekly magazine Shonen Sunday.A family legacy, an inherited magical power, an attractive girl next door and fighting against monsters all come together in this humorous coming-of-age shonen manga. The kekkaishi are "barrier masters" who trap demons in a kind of force field, and Yoshimori is the latest to enter the family business. He's powerful but unsure of his talent&#x2014;what he really wants is to bake cakes. He's also confused by his relationship with Tokine, the female successor of a competing neighboring clan. Yoshimori is only two years younger than Tokine, but the age gap often results in his losing out to her in battle. In addition, Tokine is happy with her role instead of chafing against family strictures. Although the two have similar backgrounds, constraints and pets (centuries-old demon dogs), this is clearly his story, with her as a supporting character. The obvious comparison is <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, but the way Yoshimori's grandfather froths at mention of the other family's name, it's more like the Hatfields and the McCoys. Scenes of adventurous monster-trapping alternate with surprisingly solid character development. The character designs are cute but not cloying, and a strong but restrained use of black guides the eye through the pages. Tanabe's explanatory captions and diagrams allow the enjoyable story to unfold without confusion. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

No other part of the Bible has caused more controversy. Traditional interpretations of the book fall into one of three categories: the major prophecies that are supposed to have been fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 A.D./ the historical view that Revelation predicts the course of human events from the founding of Christianity to the end of the world/ or the futurist view that Revelation predicts events that will occur at the end of the world.</p><p>It's actually none of the above, writes Zachary F. Lansdowne, a leading expert in the field of spiritual initiation. In the Introduction to this rich and complex interpretation, he writes, "According to its own verses, the Revelation is concerned with the present time, which is whatever time we happen to be reading it, and contains information that we can apply immediately to become blessed."</p><p>This is not a book about "end times" or Armageddon and when it might come. This is a book written entirely in symbols, concealing a path for early Christians, and for the contemporary reader. Lansdowne has applied a unique psychological method of interpretation that takes each symbol as depicting some aspect of human consciousness rather than an eternal event, thus showing that the Revelation is actually a detailed instruction for the spiritual journeya map to the wakening of higher consciousness. Moreover, while the Revelation appears in the great lineage of JudeoChristian tradition, Lansdowne shows that its instruction can be appreciated and applied to seekers from any tradition.</p><p>Lansdowne's linebyline and versebyverse interpretationpresented here in an easytoread sidebyside formatis a manual for the true seeker who would follow teachings of Jesus as they were and are laid out, rather than as they have been interpreted by theologians and biblical historians. <i>The Revelation of St. John</i>, when unlocked by the key of psychological methodology, is revealed to contain ideas from many diverse wisdom traditions and philosophiesarchangels in Judaism, chakras and kundalini in Hinduism, Buddhist mindfulness, the redemptive power of love in Christianity, and absolute standards of comparison in Platonic philosophy. Zachary Lansdowne's revelatory text makes these teachings of the path to true soul initiation available to seekers from every spiritual tradition.</p></p><p><p>Zachary Lansdowne is a past president of the Theosophical Society in Boston and has spoken at conferences throughout the United States.

Her novels include <i>Lilian's Story</i>, (winner of the prestigious Australian/Vogel Literary Award), <i>Albion's Story</i>, <i>Joan Makes History</i>, and <i>Dreamhouse</i>.The fifth novel by Australian author Grenville (Lilian's Story, Joan Makes History) won Britain's prestigious Orange Prize last year and, at its best, it's easy to see why. It is an oddly uneven book, however, sometimes dazzlingly lyrical, compassionate and smart, but occasionally arch and rather clumsy. In the tiny backwater town of Karakarook, New South Wales, where everyone knows everyone else's business, two improbable outsiders fall very tentatively in love. Douglas Cheeseman is an engineer, sent to replace a historic bridge some townsfolk believe could be made into a tourist attraction. Museum curator Harley Savage has come from Sydney to create an exhibit of rural applied arts. The atmosphere of the town and the sunbaked, somnolent countryside is brilliantly rendered, and so, usually, are the prickly, deeply self-doubting lead characters; the use of a wonderfully observed dog as Harley's companion throughout is masterly. At other times, however, Grenville seems to be mocking her protagonists, as when Douglas is backed up to a fence by some cows, and the climactic scene, where he does something unwontedly brave, is forced. The subplot about a banker's self-regarding wife who allows herself to be seduced by a Chinese-born butcher is too coy by half. These elements are only disappointing because the book, when on target, is so remarkably clear-sighted about, yet fond of, its quirky characters. (Apr. 1)Forecast: The prize, noted on the cover, should certainly help to draw attention, and the book is readable and likable enough to earn good word of mouth. Admirers of Grenville's previous work are likely to be more critical.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Umbrian Thursday Night Supper Club</h2><p><b>The true story of the Umbrian Thursday night supper club&#x2014;and the five extraordinary women who meet in the hills above Italy's Orvieto to cook, eat, and tell the stories of their incredible lives</b><br><br>Every week on a Thursday evening, a group of four Italian rural women gather in a derelict stone house in the hills above Italy&#x2019;s Orvieto.

And who could forget the special treat of grilled-cheese sandwich or ice-cream sundae at the famous lunch counter?<br><br>These and countless other memories are celebrated in<i> Remembering Woolworth's</i>. Packed with photos, first-hand remembrances, vivid anecdotes, and a lively, well-researched narrative, the book tells the story of how a poor potato farmer named Frank Woolworth created a merchandising empire that touched the lives of Americans in small towns, big cities, and everywhere in between. Chapters cover the store's humble beginnings, surviving the Great Depression, the civil rights sit-ins, Woolworth's around the globe, the popularity of Woolworth's collectibles, and much more.<br></p><p>In our age of nationwide discount retailers, <i>Remembering Woolworth's: A Nostalgic History of the World's Most Famous Five-and-Dime</i> provides an entertaining look back at one of retail's most successful pioneers, F.W.&nbsp;Woolworth, and his empire of department stores that defined the shopping experience for millions over the course of its 118-year existence. Woolworth, considered by his first boss to be the "worst salesman in the world," overcame repeated failure and financial hardship to open his first store in 1879 in Lancaster City, Pennsylvania. Through trial and error, the young Woolworth learned that selling large quantities of low-priced merchandise led to profit. Insightfully, Woolworth made his customers feel "rich"--and generated immense customer loyalty by offering products at affordable, nickel-and-dime prices. The Woolworth Building in lower Manhattan, the tallest in the world upon its completion in 1913, embodied the strength of the retail empire that, at its peak, consisted of over 10,000 stores worldwide. The corporation was eventually sold in 1997.<p> <i>Remembering Woolworth's</i> combines personal testimony, black-and-white and color photos, and period graphics to create a friendly, scrapbook feel. Karen Plunkett-Powell adeptly explores the personal and professional sides of F.W.&nbsp;Woolworth and the success of his "Red-Fronts" both domestically and abroad. She is at her best, however, in recapturing the particulars of the Woolworth shopping experience: the counter girls, seasonal traditions, collectibles, and lunch counters. At times historically light and colloquial, <i>Remembering Woolworth's</i> nevertheless brings back to life one of retail's most influential entrepreneurs and one of the world's most endearing department stores. <i>--Bertina Loeffler-Sedlack</i></p>Karen Plunkett-Powel is the author of <i>The Nancy Drew Scrapbook </i>and the coauthor of <i>Home Design from the Inside-Out</i>.

If you&#x2019;ve ever stared gloomily at a blank page, battled with office administrators or driven yourself (and everyone you know) mad by droning on about your work, then <i>Notes on a Thesis</i> will make you laugh (or cry) in recognition.</p><br></p><p><b>Tiphaine Rivi�re</b> spent three years writing a thesis in literature and working in administration at the PhD school of a large university in Paris, before starting the blog that became <i>Notes on a Thesis</i>."Quite possibly the funniest book about academic life since David Lodge&#x2019;s <i>Changing Places</i>. How brilliantly she captures its veiled bitchiness; how expertly &#x2013; yet lovingly too &#x2013; she sends up the silly cul-de-sacs of scholarship . . . This is a book for anyone who has ever laboured under a deadline... Put off what you intended to do today and go out and buy it, right now." &#x2014;Rachel Cooke, <i>Observer</i><br><br>"In a genre still dominated by boys/men with super-exciting lives, this tale of an intense, anxious young woman pulling her hair out over the credibility of her labyrinth-motif angle on Kafka makes for an unusual, but very funny and satisfying read.

Between one winsome grandfather and one lucky little boy are keepsakes of the heart... memories made by the two of them for all time. Most are simple. Checkers and hot chocolate. Hugs and silly songs. A special wink that means we re in this together. But their time together is coming to an end. With insight and tenderness, author Susan Jones tells the story of what comes next for a little boy who discovers memory-making is a language of love that can be whispered across the years.</p><p>Author Susan Jones grew up in Lockport, New York. She currently resides and teaches in Connecticut. Susan&#39;s favorite getaway for inspiration is the Adirondacks, where there is time to reflect upon the many people young and old, innocent and wise who have touched her heart. This book is a celebration of their generosity and tenderness.I believe the author may do for youth what Elizabeth Kubler Ross did to sensitize adults to death and dying. The experience of illness and dying is confusing and frightening to young children as well as their parents who find themselves searching for appropriate words of explanation. Until We Meet Again, a beautifully written book, provides insights into the end of life mystery with the simplicity and tenderness needed for the child to understand death as a natural part of life. --Dorothy C. Matrian M.S., LPC., Winnifred A. Kelley BSN, MPA.<br><br>Susan Jones has beautifully crafted a story of memory making that can help children, as well as adults, cope with loss, grieving and healing. I highly recommend this wonderful book for parents, grandparents, and all who live and work with children. --Kim Nagle, Executive Director, The Cove Center for Grieving Children<br><br>This poignant children s book handles the subject of loss in an elegant manner. Gently, the coming and going of generations and the naturalness of life's cycle are put into clear focus. I recommend this book as a wonderful tool to begin understanding, dialogue, and healing. --Robert J. Ancona, MD, Chief, Department of Pediatrics, St. Joseph Medical Center --Robert J.

It is a novel in which we see Jesus, the man, living quietly in Nazareth as he has for many years. He is still known as Yeshua Bar Joseph. And he is enduring a winter of no rain, endless dust and looming trouble in Judea. <br><br>Legends of a virgin birth have long surrounded Yeshua, yet for decades he has lived no differently than the others who come to the synagogue on the Sabbath. All who know and love him find themselves waiting for some sign of the path he will eventually take.<br><br>And at last we see this quiet man emerge from his baptism to confront his destiny&#x2013;and the Devil. We see what occurs when he takes the water of seven great limestone jars and transforms it into cool red wine; when he is recognized as the anointed one; when he is urged to call all Israel to take up arms against Rome and follow him as the prophets have foretold. <br><br><b>Like Out of Egypt</b>, the first novel in Anne Rice&#x2019;s series on the life of Christ, <b>The Road to Cana</b> is based on the gospels and on the most respected New Testament scholarship. The book&#x2019;s power comes from the profound feeling its author brings to the writing and the subtlety with which she summons up the presence of Jesus.</p><p>Anne Rice is the author of twenty-seven books. She lives in Rancho Mirage, CaliforniaWho is Christ the Lord?<br><br>Angels sang at his birth. Magi from the East brought gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They gave these gifts to him, and to his mother, Mary, and the man, Joseph, who claimed to be his father.<br><br>In the Temple, an old man gathered the babe in his arms. The old man said to the Lord, as he held the babe, &#x201c;A light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother told me those stories.<br><br>That was years and years ago.<br><br>Is it possible that Christ the Lord is a carpenter in the town of Nazareth, a man past thirty years of age, and one of a family of carpenters, a family of men and women and children that fill ten rooms of an ancient house, and, that in this winter of no rain, of endless dust, of talk of trouble in Judea, Christ the Lord sleeps in a worn woolen robe, in a room with other men, beside a smoking brazier? Is it possible that in that room, asleep, he dreams?<br><br>Yes. I know it&#x2019;s possible. I am Christ the Lord. I know. What I must know, I know. And what I must learn, I learn.<br><br>And in this skin, I live and sweat and breathe and groan. My shoulders ache. My eyes are dry from these dreadful rainless days&#x2013;from the long walks to Sepphoris through the gray fields in which the seeds burn under the dim winter sun because the rains don&#x2019;t come.<br><br>I am Christ the Lord. I know. Others know, but what they know they often forget. My mother hasn&#x2019;t spoken a word on it for years. My foster father, Joseph, is old now, white haired, and given to dreaming.<br><br>I never forget.<br><br>And as I fall asleep, sometimes I&#x2019;m afraid&#x2013;because my dreams are not my friends. My dreams are wild like bracken or sudden hot winds that sweep down into the parched valleys of Galilee.<br><br>But I do dream, as all men dream.<br><br>And so this night, beside the brazier, hands and feet cold, under my cloak, I dreamed.<br><br>I dreamed of a woman, close, a woman, mine, a woman who became a maiden who became in the easy tumult of dreams my Avigail.<br><br>I woke. I sat up in the dark. All the others lay sleeping still, with open mouths, and the coals in the brazier were ashes.<br><br><i>Go away, beloved girl. This is not for me to know, and Christ the Lord will not know what he does not want to know&#x2013;or what he would know only by the shape of its absence.<br><br></i>She wouldn&#x2019;t go&#x2013;not this, the Avigail of dreams with hair tumbled down loose over my hands, as if the Lord had made her for me in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>No. Perhaps the Lord made dreams for such knowing&#x2013; or so it seemed for Christ the Lord.<br><br>I climbed up off the mat, and quietly as I could, I put more coals into the brazier. My brothers and my nephews didn&#x2019;t stir. James was off with his wife tonight in the room they shared. Little Judas and Little Joseph, fathers both, slept here tonight away from little ones huddled around their wives. And there lay the sons of James&#x2013;Menachim, Isaac, and Shabi, tumbled together like puppies.<br><br>I stepped over one after another and took a clean robe from the chest, the wool smelling of the sunshine in which it had been dried. Everything in that chest was clean.<br><br>I took the robe and went out of the house. Blast of cold air in the empty courtyard. Crunch of broken leaves.<br><br>And for a moment in the hard pebbly street I stopped and looked up at the great sweep of glittering stars beyond the huddled rooftops.<br><br>Cloudless, this cold sky, and so filled with these infinitesimal lights, it seemed for a moment beautiful. My heart hurt. It seemed to be looking at me, enfolding me&#x2013;a thing of kindness and witness&#x2013;an immense web flung out by a single hand&#x2013;rather than the vast inevitable hollow of the night above the tiny slumbering town that spilled like a hundred others down a slope between distant caves of bones and thirsting fields, and groves of olive trees.<br><br>I was alone.<br><br>Somewhere far down the hill, near the sometime marketplace, a man sang in a low drunken voice and a spark of light shone there, in the doorway of the sometime tavern. Echo of laughter.<br><br>But all the rest was quiet, without a torch to light the way.<br><br>The house of Avigail across from ours was shut up like any other. Inside, Avigail, my young kinswoman, slept with Silent Hannah, her sweet companion, and the two old women who served her and the bitter man, Shemayah, who was her father.<br><br>Nazareth did not always have a beauty. I&#x2019;d seen generations of young maidens grow up, each fresh and lovely to behold as any flower in the wild. Fathers did not want their daughters to be beauties. But Nazareth had a beauty now, and it was Avigail. She&#x2019;d refused two suitors of late, or so her father had done on her behalf, and there was a real question in the minds of the women of our house as to whether Avigail herself even knew the suitors had come calling.<br><br>It fell hard on me suddenly that I would sometime very soon be standing among the torchbearers at her wedding. Avigail was fifteen. She might have been married a year ago, but Shemayah kept her close. Shemayah was a rich man who had but one thing and one thing alone that made him happy, and that was his daughter, Avigail.<br><br>I walked up the hill and over the top. I knew every family behind every door. I knew the few strangers who came and went, one huddled in a courtyard outside the Rabbi&#x2019;s house, and the other on the roof above where so many slept, even in winter. It was a town of day-to-day quiet, and seemingly not a single secret.<br><br>I walked down the other side of the slope until I came to the spring, the dust rising with every step I took, until I was coughing from it.<br><br>Dust and dust and dust.<br><br>Thank You, Father of the Universe, that this night is not so cold, no, not as cold as it might be, and send us the rain in Your own good time because You know that we need it.<br><br>Passing the synagogue, I could hear the spring before I saw it.<br><br>The spring was drying up, but for now it still ran, and it filled the two large rock-cut basins in the side of the hill, and spilled down in glistening streaks to the rocky bed it followed off and away into the distant forest.<br><br>The grass grew soft here and fragrant.<br><br>I knew that in less than an hour, the women would be coming, some to fill jugs, others, the poorer women, to wash their clothes here as best they could and beat them on the rocks.<br><br>But for now the spring was mine.<br><br>I stripped off the old robe and flung it down into the creek bed where the water soon filled it up and darkened it to where I couldn&#x2019;t see it. I set the clean robe aside and approached the basin. With my cupped hands I bathed in the cold water, drenching my hair, my face, my chest, letting it run down my back and my legs. Yes, cast away the dreams like the old robe, and bathe them away. The dream woman has no name now and no voice, and what it was, that painful flicker when she laughed or reached out, well, that was gone, fading, like the night itself was fading, and gone too was the dust for this moment, the suffocating dust. There was only cold. There was only water.<br><br>I lay down on the far bank, opposite the synagogue. The birds had begun, and as always I&#x2019;d missed the exact moment. It was a game I played, trying to hear the very first of the birds, the birds that knew the sun was coming when no one else did.<br><br>I could see the big thick palm trees around the synagogue emerging from the clump of shapeless shadows. Palms could grow in a drought. Palms didn&#x2019;t care if the dust coated every branch. Palms went on as if made for all seasons.<br><br>The cold was outside me. I think my beating heart kept me warm. Then the first light seeped up over the distant bluff, and I picked up the fresh robe, and slipped it over my head. So good, this, this luxuriously clean cloth, this fresh-smelling cloth.<br><br>I lay back down again and my thoughts drifted. I felt the breeze before I heard the trees sigh with it.<br><br>Far up the hill was an old olive grove to which I loved to go at times to be alone. I thought of it now. How good it would be to lie in that soft bed of dead leaf and sleep the day away.<br><br>But there was no chance of it, not now with the tasks that had to be done, and with the village charged with new worries and new talk over a new Roman Governor come to Judea, who, until he settled in as every other Governor had done, would trouble the land from one end to the other.<br><br>The land. When I say the land, I mean Judea and Galilee as well. I mean the Holy Land, the Land of Israel, the Land of God. It was no matter that this man didn&#x2019;t govern us. He governed Judea and the Holy City where the Temple stood, and so he might as well have been our King instead of Herod Antipas. They worked together, these two, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, and this new man, Pontius Pilate, whom men feared, and beyond Jordan Herod Philip ruled and worked with them as well. And so the land had been carved up for a long, long time, and Antipas and Philip we knew, but Pontius Pilate we didn&#x2019;t know and the reports were already evil.<br><br>What could a carpenter in Nazareth do about it? Nothing, but when there was no rain, when men were restive and angry and full of fear, when people spoke of the curse of Heaven on the withering grass, and Roman slights, and an anxious Emperor gone into exile in mourning for a son poisoned, when all the world seemed filled with the pressure to put one&#x2019;s shoulder to it and push, well, in such a time, I didn&#x2019;t go off to the grove of trees to sleep the day away.<br><br>It was getting light.<br><br>A figure broke from the dark shapes of the houses of the village, hurrying downhill towards me, one hand upraised. <br><br>My brother James. Older brother&#x2013;son of Joseph and Joseph&#x2019;s first wife who died before Joseph married my mother.

No good will come of your investigation," says Nanny Tess to David Ash, paranormal investigator, in this disappointing horror tale. An associate of the Psychical Research Institute, Ash visits Edbrook, a lonely mansion in the British countryside, at the behest of the Mariell siblings--Christina, Robert and Simon--playful, immature children in grown-up bodies, and their aunt, Nanny Tess, all of whom have seen ghosts and strange sights aplenty in their ancestral home. Ash, who has a reputation as a skeptic and debunker, wonders if a deliberate attempt to discredit him is taking place (or is his incipient alcoholism catching up with him?) when he follows a ghostly figure through the grounds to a small garden pond.

She&#x2019;d already seen him twice since her enrollment at Climping Academy the previous fall. The first time, she&#x2019;d been turned in for cutting PE. The second time, she&#x2019;d been reported for smoking outside study hall. She&#x2019;d been advised there was a smoking area set aside specifically for students, which she argued was on the far side of campus and impossible to get to between classes. That fell on deaf ears. This was now early January and she&#x2019;d been reported for violating the school&#x2019;s dress code.</p><p>She was willing to admit that detention slips were a poor means of establishing her place in a new school. The younger students wore uniforms, but in the upper grades, clothing was at the discretion of the individual student as long as the overall look was considered within bounds. The way Iris read it&#x2014;no skirts or dresses with hemlines above the knee, no tank tops, no shorts, no T-shirts with slogans, no underwear showing, and no flip-flops or Doc Martens. As far as she was concerned, she was playing by the rules. She&#x2019;d assumed she could wear anything she pleased, within reason, of course. Climp had a different point of view. In the minds of the school administrators, clothing was meant to show modesty, respect, conservatism, and seriousness of purpose.</p><p>Her choice that morning had been an ankle-length claret-colored velvet dress with a ruffled collar, long sleeves, black tights, and high-top red tennis shoes. Her hair was long and thick, a color that fell somewhere between auburn and flame red thanks to a mixture of boxed dyes. Two big silver barrettes held the mass away from her face. On each wrist she wore a wide leather cuff, studded with brass and silver nail heads. As it turned out, all of this was a great big no-no. Well, shit.</p><p>The school secretary, Mrs. Malcolm, acknowledged Iris&#x2019;s presence with a nod, but clearly the woman didn&#x2019;t intend to interrupt her work over the antics of a problematic ninth grader. She was busy distributing mail to various teachers&#x2019; cubbyholes. A student volunteer, Poppy, was stapling together packets of some sort. Iris was a freshman at Climping Academy, the Santa Teresa private school located in Horton&nbsp;Ravine, which was so la-di-da, it totally freaked her out. She was only at Climp because her father had been hired to teach advanced placement math and to coach field hockey. The tuition was twenty thousand dollars a year, which her parents could never have afforded if not for her father&#x2019;s job, which allowed Climp to waive the cost of enrollment.</p><p>The last high school she&#x2019;d attended was in a &#x201c;mixed&#x201d; neighborhood in Detroit, which was to say, drugs, thugs, and vandalism, some of which Iris had generated herself when the mood struck her. She&#x2019;d been uprooted from Michigan and plunked down on the West Coast despite her protests. California was a bust. She expected surfers, dopers, and free spirits, but it was all the same old shit as far as she could tell. Climping Academy was beyond belief. Enrollment from kindergarten to twelfth grade was three hundred students total, with a pupil-to-teacher ratio of nine to one. Expectations were high and most of the students rose to the occasion. And why would they not? These were all rich kids, whose mommies and daddies gave them the best of everything: trips abroad, unlimited clothing budgets, private tennis and fencing lessons, and weekly visits with a shrink&#x2014;the latter just in case some boob was gifted with a brand-new VW instead of the BMW he had his heart set on. Big boo-fucking-hoo. Her parents often expressed doubts about her private school attendance, citing the pressure to conform and the dangers of materialism. Her parents fancied themselves Bohemians.</p><p>One look at her outfit and her homeroom teacher, Mrs. Rubio, had informed her she&#x2019;d have to go home and change, and when she told Mrs. Rubio she had no transportation, the woman had suggested she take a bus. Like, huh? Iris didn&#x2019;t know anything about bus schedules, so what was she supposed to do? Unlike most of the other students, she didn&#x2019;t live in snooty old Horton Ravine. Moving from Michigan to California had been a shock, the sticker prices for homes being exorbitant. Her parents had purchased a shabby rambling house on the Upper East Side with a mortgage that would keep them enslaved for life. How Bohemian was that? Iris was an only child. Her parents had&nbsp;never wanted children in the first place, a sentiment they were happy&nbsp;to remind her of at the drop of a hat. Her mother, at the age of �twenty-five, went in to have her tubes tied against medical advice, and �discovered she was pregnant. Husband and wife had agonized over whether to terminate, and in the end they decided it was acceptable to have one child. Often in Iris&#x2019;s hearing, they congratulated themselves on their parenting style, which consisted largely of instilling independence in the girl, meaning an ability to entertain herself and demand precious little.</p><p>Her mother had a degree in political science and was currently teaching part time at Santa Teresa City College. She also volunteered two afternoons a week at an abortion clinic, where she felt it was incumbent on her to champion reproductive rights, women&#x2019;s control over their own bodies, and the advisability of women keeping their options open instead of burdening themselves with unwanted offspring.</p><p>Meanwhile, having witnessed the sophistication of Horton Ravine, Iris was embarrassed by the way she was forced to live. On the home front, her parents favored clutter and disarray&#x2014;imagining perhaps that untidiness and intellectual superiority walked hand in hand. Iris couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time the three of them sat down to a meal. Dishes were left in the sink since neither her mother nor father could be bothered with such things. Dusting and vacuuming were too mundane to address. Laundry went undone. If one of them broke down and actually washed and dried a load, it was left in a pile on the living room sofa to be reclaimed as needed. Iris did her own. Her parents believed it was exploitative of the lower classes to hire household help, so those chores were best left a-begging. They were also committed to the notion of equality between the sexes, which spawned an unspoken competition to see who could force the other to knuckle under and pick up the slack. Iris&#x2019;s bedroom was the only orderly room in the house and she spent most of her free time there isolated from the chaos.</p><p>Mr. Lucas appeared in the doorway to his office indicating that she should come in. He was a good-looking man, low-key, relaxed, and competent. His hair was the color of California beach sand, his face nicely creased. He was tall and trim, given to cashmere vests and dress shirts with the sleeves rolled up. He tossed a file on his desk and took a seat, lacing his fingers above his head. &#x201c;Mrs. Rubio has lodged an objection to your outfit,&#x201d; he remarked. &#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re on your way to the Renaissance Faire.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever that is,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;This is the third detention you&#x2019;ve been cited for since you arrived. I don&#x2019;t understand this pattern of defiance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why is it a pattern when I&#x2019;ve only done two things wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Counting today, that makes three. You&#x2019;re here to learn, not to do battle with school authorities. I&#x2019;m not sure you appreciate the opportunity you&#x2019;ve been given.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a shit about that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;All my friends are back in Detroit. With all due respect, Mr. Lucas, Climping Academy sucks.&#x201d;</p><p>She saw that Mr. Lucas was prepared to ignore her bad language, probably thinking the issue of trash talk was not what was at stake. &#x201c;I went back and looked at your records. At your last school, you did good work. Here you&#x2019;ve set yourself on a collision course. You miss your friends. I get that. I&#x2019;m also aware California isn&#x2019;t an easy place to live if you&#x2019;re accustomed to the Midwest, but you keep on acting out, you&#x2019;re only hurting yourself. Does that make sense to you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the deal? Three demerits and I&#x2019;m out?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t give up as easily as that. Like it or not, you&#x2019;re here three more years. We want the time to be pleasant and productive. You think you can handle that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>She studied the floor. For some reason, she was stung by his tone, which was kind. His concern seemed genuine, which made it all the worse. She didn&#x2019;t want to fit in. She didn&#x2019;t want to adapt. She wanted to go back to Detroit, where she knew she was accepted for who she was. In that moment, Iris realized she had violated her own working strategy in situations like this. The trick was to look abject and give a lengthy explanation for the infraction, which might or might not be true. The point was to fill the air with verbiage, to apologize at least twice, sounding as sincere as possible for someone who didn&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass. The secret was to put up no resistance whatever, a technique that had worked well for her in the past. Resistance only fueled the lecture, encouraging the adult-types to pontificate.</p><p>She murmured, &#x201c;What about my clothes? I don&#x2019;t drive, so there&#x2019;s no way I can go home and change.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, that I can help you with. Where do you live?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Upper East Side.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on a minute.&#x201d;</p><p>He got up from his desk and crossed to the door to the school office, which he opened, sticking his head out. &#x201c;Mrs. Malcolm, can you do me a favor and let me borrow Poppy for half an hour? Iris needs a ride home. Upper East Side. There and back, thirty minutes max.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. If it&#x2019;s all right with her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. Happy to.&#x201d;</p><p>Iris could feel her heart start to bang in her chest. Poppy was one of the most popular girls at Climp, operating at such an elevation that Iris barely had the nerve to speak to her. She was close to panic at the idea of being in a moving vehicle with her for even ten minutes, let alone thirty.</p><p>Once in the parking lot, Poppy turned to her with a grin. &#x201c;Cool threads, kid. I wish I had your nerve.&#x201d;</p><p>The two got into Poppy&#x2019;s Thunderbird. Once Iris slammed the car door, she reached into her bag and pulled out a vintage Lucky Strike cigarette tin, filled with tightly rolled joints, at which Iris was adept. &#x201c;Care to partake?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, shit yes,&#x201d; Poppy said.</p><p>That had been January and the two had been inseparable since. To Iris&#x2019;s credit, she was a model of good behavior for the next three months.</p><p>Every afternoon, they repaired to Poppy&#x2019;s house, ostensibly to study, but actually to smoke dope and raid Poppy&#x2019;s parents&#x2019; liquor cabinet. Iris was a genius at concocting mixed drinks, utilizing what was available. Her latest she called a &#x201c;flame thrower,&#x201d; which entailed Kahl�a, banana-flavored liqueur, cr�me de menthe, and rum. Poppy&#x2019;s parents didn&#x2019;t drink rum. That bottle was held in reserve should a guest request it. Poppy&#x2019;s father was a thoracic surgeon, her mother a hospital administrator, which meant long hours for both and a pre�occupation with medical matters, gossip as much as anything else. Poppy&#x2019;s two older sisters had graduated from college. One was now in medical school and the other was working for a pharmaceutical company. The whole family was high-profile and high-achievement. Poppy was an oopsie baby&#x2014;a surprise addition to the family, arriving long after Poppy&#x2019;s mother assumed she&#x2019;d been liberated from diapers, teething, pediatricians, PTA meetings, and soccer practice. Iris and Poppy had that in common, their alien state. It was as though both had been deposited by spacecraft, leaving the mystified earthlings to raise them as best they could.</p><p>Most of the time the two girls were on their own, ordering pizza or any other foodstuff that could be charged to a credit card and delivered to Poppy&#x2019;s door. At least she could drive and she often delivered Iris to her house at ten at night. Iris&#x2019;s parents never said a word, probably grateful she had a friend whose company she preferred to theirs.</p><p>In April, Iris was dumbfounded when she received yet another summons to the vice principal&#x2019;s office. What&#x2019;d she do this time? She hadn&#x2019;t been called out on anything and she felt put upon and unappreciated. She&#x2019;d been doing her best to blend in and behave herself.</p><p>Even Mrs. Malcolm seemed surprised. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t seen you for a while. What now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No clue. I&#x2019;m tooling along minding my own business and I get this note that Mr. Lucas wants to see me. I don&#x2019;t even know what this is about.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;News to me as well.&#x201d;</p><p>Iris took a seat on one of the wooden benches provided for the errant and unrepentant. She had her books and her binder in hand so that once she was properly dressed down, she could report to her next class, which in this case was world history. She opened her binder, pretending to check her notes. She was careful to show no interest in the secretary&#x2019;s disbursement of manila envelopes, but she knew what they contained: the Benchmark California Academic Proficiency Tests. These were administered at the beginning and end of junior year, designed to measure each student&#x2019;s mastery of math and En�glish. Poppy had been bitching for weeks about having to perform up to grade level or suffer the indignities of remedial catch-up work. Under certain circumstances, the test results would determine whether a junior was even allowed to advance to senior year. Iris wondered if there was a way to get her hands on a copy. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be a coup? Poppy was her best friend, a diligent student, but not all that bright. Iris could see her limitations, but overlooked her deficits in the �interest of her status at Climp. Poppy&#x2019;s boyfriend, Troy Rademaker, was in somewhat the same boat. His grades were excellent, but he didn&#x2019;t dare risk anything less than top marks. He attended Climp on a scholarship it was essential to protect. In addition, he and Austin Brown were among the nominees for the Albert Climping Memorial Award, given annually to an outstanding freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior based on academic distinction, athletic achievement, and service to the community. Austin Brown was the unofficial but equally undisputed kingpin of the junior class, much admired and equally feared for his scathing pronouncements about his classmates.</p><p>Poppy wasn&#x2019;t conventionally pretty, but she was stylish and well-liked. Schoolwork was her curse. She was one of those borderline cases where year after year, teachers had talked themselves into passing her along without requiring a command of core subjects. This had always worked to Poppy&#x2019;s advantage, keeping her in lockstep with classmates she&#x2019;d known since kindergarten. The problem was that grade by grade, she&#x2019;d been advanced on increasingly shaky grounds, which meant the work only became harder and more opaque. Now Poppy alternated between feelings of frustration and feelings of despair. Iris&#x2019;s role, as she saw it, was to take Poppy&#x2019;s mind off her scholastic woes, thus the dope-smoking and junk food.</p></b></p><h2>Speed Secrets II: More Professional Race Driving Techniques</h2><p>Discover the secrets that will make you a faster and more successful racecar driver with this up-to-date insight into the latest techniques in racing.

From ballot stuffing and intimidating voters, to buying votes, suppressing turnout and manipulating returns, <i>Deliver the Vote</i> is an intensive examination into the hidden interiors of American politics that casts a provocative new light on how power in America is often obtained. Drawing on hundreds of elections from the colonial era to the 2004 election, historian Tracy Campbell reveals how a long-standing culture of corruption is alive and well in local, state, and national elections. Among those whose stories are central to this book are Boss Tweed, William Randolph Hearst, Huey Long, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Jimmy Carter, as well as countless local and state politicians of every stripe. Combining social and political history in a vivid narrative, <i>Deliver the Vote</i> reveals how fraud has been a persistent and corrosive presence in American history, and is not confined to one party, location, or time period.<br><br>Campbell explores every major reform to cleanse fraud and corruption&#x2014;paper ballots, the secret ballot, or voting machines&#x2014;and explains how they have only changed the way the game is played, sadly showing how American elections have never been in order.</p><p>Tracy Campbell is the author of THE POLITICS OF DESPAIR: POWER AND RESISTANCE IN THE TOBACCO WARS; and SHORT OF THE GLORY: THE FALL AND REDEMPTION OF EDWARD F. PRITCHARD, JR., which tells the story of a brilliant politician&#39;s demise due to ballot box stuffing. SHORT OF THE GLORY was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and was featured on NPR&#39;s &#34;Morning Edition&#34; program. Campbell is Associate Professor of History and Co-Director of the Wendell H. Ford Public Policy Research Center at the University of Kentucky.*Starred Review* According to Campbell, buying votes, stuffing or destroying ballots, moving polling locations, transposing results, importing illegal voters from other towns or states, and suppressing, disenfranchising, and sometimes killing voters comprises a long, sordid tradition in American political culture. Despite all the changes in the mechanics of voting and the apparent safeguards, how has fraud--flagrant and subtle--persisted, Campbell asks. The answer, so Campbell argues, is a deeply embedded culture within American politics that considers cheating fully justifiable. The author indicates that those contributing to this "culture of corruption" have not been limited to cigar-chomping party bosses. Precinct captains, poll officials, and police officers were involved, as well as teachers, lawyers, and clergy. Campbell insists that his aim is to use selected examples from various eras and locales to describe how this culture has developed and survived over the years, believing that the solution is to be aware that there is a problem and to confront the truth that election fraud has been a common component in our nation's electoral history. The book's conclusions lead to the realization that election fraud is a crime that usually pays, which will come as no surprise to most readers; but the author's meticulously researched book stands without rivals as the most balanced and comprehensive on the subject. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

His leaps of imagination changed forever the way we look at the universe. He gained international celebrity by the very force of his personality, his wry sense of humor (often at the expense of himself), and his limitless humanity.<br><br>The mind of Albert Einstein bulged at the seams not only with mathematics and physics but also with an insatiable curiosity about life itself. His wide-ranging observations and opinions about the nature of life and the world--not to mention the life and world of nature--are rich in insight, wit, and wisdom. His vision also us a unique opportunity to see ourselves. His thoughts are treasures in small packages; taken as a whole, they offer images and ideas of what we are and what it is possible to be.<br></p><p>This little volume is chock-full of fun and intriguing quotes from everyone's favorite scientist: Einstein. Read what he has to say about life, morality, philosophy, art and music, science and mathematics, politics, religion, social issues, war and peace, and himself. His views on life, religion, philosophy, and many other issues are as relevant today as they were when he was living. Including a brief biography of the physicist and an amusing bit of doggerel by Einstein himself, <i>Bite-Size Einstein</i> reveals his brilliant perspective on the human condition.Jerry Mayer and John P. Holms collaborated on the one-man show <i>you know Al, he's a funny guy</i>.

In fact, the circuitry of the brain actually changes according to how one uses it. Our brains are continuously developing new capacities and refinements&#x2014;or losing them, depending upon how we use them. Gerald H�ther takes us on a fascinating tour of the brain's development&#x2014;from one-celled organisms to worms, moles, apes, and on to us humans&#x2014;showing how we truly are what we think: our behavior directly affects our brain capacity. And the behavior that promotes the fullest development of the brain is behavior that balances emotion and intellect, dependence and autonomy, openness and focus, and ultimately expresses itself in such virtues as truthfulness, considerateness, sincerity, humility, and love. <br><br>H�ther's user's-manual approach is humorous and engaging, with a minimum of technical language, yet the book's message is profound: the fundamental nature of our brains and nervous systems naturally leads to our continued growth in intelligence and humanity.</p><p><b>Gerald H�ther</b>, PhD, is&nbsp;the&nbsp;head of the Department of Fundamental Neurobiological Research at the psychiatric clinic of G�ttingen, Germany. His research concerns the effects of fear, stress, psychological addiction, and nourishment on the brain. <i>The Compassionate Brain: How Empathy Creates Intelligence </i>was the first of his numerous books to appear in English.A kind of users manual for the human brain, neurobiologist H�ther's work explains in straightforward terms how the brain works, how our environment and behavior affect its development, and recommendations for the most effective ways to encourage our brains (and our children's) to operate at the highest possible levels. Beginning with the scientific basics of brain function, H�ther's discussion ranges from the history of European philosophy (especially Plato, Kant and Heidegger) to current trends encouraged by the mass media. Especially striking are the final sections of the book, which begin with a quote from seventeenth-century Jesuit writer Baltasar Gracian, whose theological investigations of human conduct reach the same conclusions as H�ther's laboratory research: humans must encourage all actions and mental habits that engender feelings of deep personal concern (empathy) and reject those that do not. Although the discussion avoids moralizing, H�ther's conclusions border at times on the apocalyptic, with visions of a human race trained by TV, advertising, video games and consumerism to content themselves with material comfort and overstimulation, to the point that they become nearly incapable of survival. H�ther is an engaging writer, however, and this concise, elegant work will appeal to a great many readers, from those interested in neuroscience and psychology to those interested in philosophy, religion, and history.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Though he wants to use her only as a model, Lee convinces him to take her on as his assistant and teach her everything he knows. As they work together in the darkroom, their personal and professional lives become intimately entwined, changing the course of Lee's life forever.<br><br>Lee's journey of self-discovery takes took her from the cabarets of bohemian Paris to the battlefields of war-torn Europe during WWII, from inventing radical new photography techniques to documenting the liberation of the concentration camps as one of the first female war correspondents. Through it all, Lee must grapple with the question of whether it's possible to stay true to herself while also fulfilling her artistic ambition--and what she will have to sacrifice to do so. <br><br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2019:</strong> Lee Miller was already an accomplished model when she made her way to Paris in the 1930s, but her aim was to be behind the camera. A chance meeting with famed Surrealist photographer Man Ray set this plan in motion, and revealed that Miller&#x2019;s artistic ability--and her ambition&#x2014;rivaled that of her mentor (and eventual lover). Whitney Scharer&#x2019;s sumptuous debut novel, <em>The Age of Light</em>, captures their passionate, and complicated, relationship, and pays homage to the pluck, determination and profound talents of a woman sometimes relegated to a footnote in Man Ray&#x2019;s history.

The relic is said to curse anyone who touches with a gruesome end as soon as it leaves their possession. Several decades pass, and the Cross turns up in the possession of a dealer who is robbed and murdered en route to Glastonbury. Investigating the death, Bernard Knight&#x2019;s protagonist, Crowner John, learns of the relic&#x2019;s dark history. In 1269, the discovery of a decapitated monk leads Ian Morson&#x2019;s academic sleuth William Falconer to uncover a link to the relic, and in 1323, Michael Jecks&#x2019; Sir Baldwin Furnshill has reason to suspect the relic&#x2019;s involvement in at least five violent deaths. Finally, the relic is dispatched to London, where it falls into the hands of an unscrupulous book dealer&#x2014;and where Philip Gooden&#x2019;s Nick Revill will determine its ultimate fate.</p><p>Linked by a common thread, the Tainted Relic, these chronologically written novellas read like a single, epic historical mystery.

After all, why give Dare the satisfaction of knowing he can push her buttons and push her to the edge?Three years ago, Dare returned home to rural western Montana and opened a hunting business to rival Angie&#x2019;s. Complicating matters is the fact that Dare has asked Angie out (not once but twice) and has given her a gift of butterflies in the process. Angie has no patience for butterflies.

She lives in Alabama with her husband and a golden retriever.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<b>Chapter One </b><br><br> He&#x2019;d won. <br> She&#x2019;d lost. <br><br> She really,&nbsp; really hated losing. Losing pissed her off more than just about anything else. <br> The very idea made her grind her teeth, made her think twice about what she was about to do, which essentially was to throw in the towel. Okay, not exactly throw in the towel, but she was defi�nitely retrenching, and she needed to act now. Stubbornness was one of her main faults, something she was well aware of, so before it could trip her up and make her change her mind, Angie Powell quickly scrawled her name on the contract with the only Realtor in the area, Harlan Forbes, then leaned back in her chair and tried to control her breathing. <br><br> There, it was done. Her place was officially up for sale. Her stomach was so knotted she felt as if she&#x2019;d stepped off a cliff and was cartwheeling toward the ground, but there was no going back. Well, there probably was; Harlan had known her most of her life, and would probably tear up the contract right now if she asked him to. Not only that, the contract wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp; open- ended. If her home didn&#x2019;t sell in the allotted time, she&#x2019;d either extend the con�tract or . . . what? What other option did she have? None, that&#x2019;s what. This was do or die, sink or swim, and any number of other back- against- the- wall clich�s. She was damned if she&#x2019;d just give up, though. Moving operations wasn&#x2019;t the same as giving up. <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get this posted online right away,&#x201d; Harlan said, swiveling around to lay the contract beside his sleek, all- in- one computer and monitor combined, a surprisingly up- to- date piece of elec�tronics in a shabby, crowded&nbsp; two- room office on the second floor above the hardware store. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s how most of my contacts are being made these days.&#x201d; He gave her a quick glance, concern writ�ten large on his florid face. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get your hopes up on having a firm offer right away, though. The listings around here are on the market for six months, average, which isn&#x2019;t bad in this economy.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said to Harlan, who&#x2019;d been one of her father&#x2019;s best friends. She supposed he needed to make the sale as much as she needed to sell. The downturn in the economy had hit every�one. Six months. God, could she hold on for six more months? The answer was: If she had to. She could do anything if she had to. <br><br> She got to her feet. &#x201c;Believe me, I&#x2019;m not hoping for anything right away.&#x201d; <br> But she was; she couldn&#x2019;t help it. She wished the place would sell this very minute, before she could think about it too much. At the same time, she dreaded the thought of leaving, and the two emotions pulled and fought inside her until she wanted to scream, for all the good that would do, which was none. <br><br> She shrugged into her coat and picked up her big tote bag, settled her hat on her head. She needed both the coat and the hat. November had come in cold and brisk, already dusting the valleys with a few light snows. The mountain peaks surrounding the valley were white, the wind blowing off them carrying the scent of winter, evergreen mixed with fresh snow. A warm front was coming in that should melt the snow back some, but everyone, human and animal, knew the warmth would be temporary; soon the cold would settle in for months. <br><br> She had to plan on being here through another winter. It would be nice if her place sold immediately, but if she was any�thing, Angie was realistic. Pie in the sky had never appealed to her, not when there was a plain old apple on the ground. Right now, however, she&nbsp; couldn&#x2019;t see either apple or pie. All she could do was try to eke out a living and stay on top of her bills enough to hold off foreclosure, until her place sold and she could relocate. <br><br> <i>If. </i>Now there was a word. <i>If </i>her dad hadn&#x2019;t borrowed a bunch of money five years ago to expand the business, buying more horses, four- wheelers, building three small guest houses, the place wouldn&#x2019;t even have a mortgage, and she&#x2019;d be okay even with the downturn in her income. But he had, and she wasn&#x2019;t. Yes, she&#x2019;d sold the four- wheelers and most of the horses, and used the money to pay down the principal on the loan, but even if she refi�nanced, the payment would be more than she could handle, and that was assuming the bank would let her refinance, as tight as credit was right now. <br><br> At least she hadn&#x2019;t waited until she was in real trouble. No, that big, wide streak of realism had read the writing on the wall and recognized that, within a year at the absolute most, she was going to be out of money and out of business, unless she took ac�tion. But a year was optimistic; the six months Harlan had men�tioned for selling her house and property was far more like it. By then, she might not even be breaking even, and one thing she didn&#x2019;t want to do was dip into her savings. For one thing, she didn&#x2019;t have that much; for another, throwing good money after bad was a good way to lose everything. <br><br> Harlan heaved his bulk out of his squeaky office chair and walked with her to the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be out tomorrow to take some pictures,&#x201d; he said. <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there. I have a guide trip day after tomorrow, so I&#x2019;ll be getting everything ready.&#x201d; Right now, that one guide trip, with a repeat client, was the only thing on her books. Three years ago, before Dare Callahan had returned home and begun carving huge holes in her business, she had gone weeks with just enough time between guide trips to replenish supplies. Even two years ago, with him set up in competition, she&#x2019;d done okay, and had ac�tually been glad to have a little time to rest between trips. Last year had been slow. This year had been disastrous. <br><br> Harlan patted her arm as he opened the door for her. &#x201c;I hate to see you leave, but you know best.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;I hope so. I&#x2019;ve done some research, and I think I&#x2019;ve found a good location, up past Missoula.&#x201d; She wasn&#x2019;t getting her heart set on any particular place, though; she&#x2019;d isolate sections where hunt�ing guides were thin on the ground, and work from there. Moving wouldn&#x2019;t accomplish much if she put herself back into a situation with steep competition. <br> He glanced out the door, at the mountainous scenery he&#x2019;d seen thousands of times, and a faintly sad expression crept over his face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking about leaving, too.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; The unexpected confession jerked Angie out of her�self and her own problems; she stared at him in shock. He&#x2019;d al�ways been here, been in these parts, and a fixture in her life from the time she and her dad had moved to the area. <i>She </i>had moved away a couple of times, once to college and then afterward to Billings, but Harlan had always been here, as reliable as the sun rising in the east. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine this place without him. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br> There was a faraway look in his eyes, as if he&#x2019;d turned inward. &#x201c;Because the older I get, the closer I am to the people who&#x2019;ve al�ready gone on, and the harder it is to relate to the ones still here,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;Some days all I can think about are the dead ones. I catch myself talking to Glory all the time.&#x201d; Gloria was his dead wife; Angie had never heard him call her anything other than Glory. &#x201c;And your dad ...I still talk to him as if he were standing right here. And there are more, too many more.&#x201d; <br><br> He sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have an unlimited number of years left, you know, and I&#x2019;m spending too much of my time alone. I need to move closer to Noah and the grandkids, connect more with them while I still can.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking as if you have one foot in the grave. You aren&#x2019;t old!&#x201d; She was still too shocked to be diplomatic, but then diplo�macy had never been her strong point. Afterward she could always think of what she <i>should </i>have said, but in the moment she tended to blurt out whatever she was thinking. Besides, Harlan <i>wasn&#x2019;t </i>old; he was probably in his mid- sixties, close to her dad in age. <br><br> But her dad was gone, and suddenly Angie thought she knew what Harlan meant. He was hearing the call of the beyond; some�times she caught the echo of it herself, in the stillness around her that would suddenly be filled with memories. Maybe it was na�ture&#x2019;s way of transitioning from life to death, or life to another life. He knew he was probably in the last quarter of his life, and he wanted to make the most of it with the people who meant the most to him. <br><br> &#x201c;Old enough,&#x201d; he said, and looked again at the looming mountains. &#x201c;If I don&#x2019;t make the move now, I might run out of time.&#x201d; <br><br> And that was it in a nutshell. She was doing exactly the same thing, though for a different reason. She was running out of time. <br><br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; she said gently. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br> Abruptly he hugged her, a&nbsp; one- armed,&nbsp; rib- crushing hug that was over before she could do more than gasp. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, Angie, but we won&#x2019;t lose touch. I promise you that.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Back at you,&#x201d; she said awkwardly. The emotion of the mo�ment left her flailing way out of her depth, as usual, but she man�aged a smile for him as she stepped out onto the landing. Some people instinctively knew the right thing to say, the right thing to do, but she wasn&#x2019;t one of them. The best she could do was, well, the best she could do, and hope she didn&#x2019;t screw up too much. <br><br> As soon as the door closed behind her, though, her smile turned sad. She didn&#x2019;t want to leave. She&#x2019;d grow...</p><h2>Your Best Body at 40+ : The 4-Week Plan to Get Back in Shape-and Stay Fit Forever!</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

But there is another, secret Dona who longs for freedom, honest love - and sweetness, even if it is spiced with danger.To escape the shallowness of court life, Dona retreats to Navron, her husband&#39;s remote Cornish estate. There, she seeks peace in its solitary woods and hidden creeks. But she finds instead a daring pirate, hunted by all Cornwall, a Frenchman who, like Dona, would gamble his life for a moment&#39;s joy. Together, they embark upon a quest rife with danger and glory, one which bestows upon Dona the ultimate choice: sacrifice her lover to certain death or risk her own life to save him.</p><p>Daphne du Maurier (1907-89) was born in London, the daughter of the famous actor-manager Sir Gerald du Maurier and granddaughter of George du Maurier, the author and artist. In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE. She lived most of her life in Cornwall, the setting for many of her books.<p>One</p> <p>W hen the east wind blows up Helford river the shining waters become troubled and disturbed and the little waves beat angrily upon the sandy shores. The short seas break above the bar at ebb-tide, and the waders fly inland to the mud-flats, their wings skimming the surface, and calling to one another as they go. Only the gulls remain, wheeling and crying above the foam, diving now and again in search of food, their grey feathers glistening with the salt spray. </p> <p>The long rollers of the Channel, travelling from beyond Lizard point, follow hard upon the steep seas at the river mouth, and mingling with the surge and wash of deep sea water comes the brown tide, swollen with the last rains and brackish from the mud, bearing upon its face dead twigs and straws, and strange forgotten things, leaves too early fallen, young birds, and the buds of flowers.</p> <p>The open roadstead is deserted, for an east wind makes uneasy anchorage, and but for the few houses scattered here and there above Helford passage, and the group of bungalows about Port Navas, the river would be the same as it was in a century now forgotten, in a time that has left few memories.</p> <p>In those days the hills and the valleys were alone in splendour, there were no buildings to desecrate the rough fields and cliffs, no chimney pots to peer out of the tall woods. There were a few cottages in Helford hamlet, but they made no impression upon the river life itself, which belonged to the birds curlew and redshank, guillemot and puffin. No yachts rode to the tide then, as they do to-day, and that stretch of placid water where the river divides to Constantine and Gweek was calm and undisturbed.</p> <p>The river was little known, save to a few mariners who had found shelter there when the south-west gales drove them inshore from their course up-channel, and they found the place lonely and austere, a little frightening because of the silence, and when the wind was fair again were glad to weigh anchor and set sail. Helford hamlet was no inducement to a sailor ashore, the few cottage folk dull-witted and uncommunicative, and the fellow who has been away from warmth and women over-long has little desire to wander in the woods or dabble with the waders in the mud at ebb-tide. So the winding river remained unvisited, the woods and the hills untrodden, and all the drowsy beauty of midsummer that gives Helford river a strange enchantment was never seen and never known.</p> <p>To-day there are many voices to blunder in upon the silence. The pleasure steamers come and go, leaving a churning wake, and yachtsmen visit one another, and even the day-tripper, his dull eye surfeited with undigested beauty, ploughs in and out amongst the shallows, a prawning net in hand. Sometimes, in a little puffing car, he jerks his way along the uneven, muddy track that leads sharply to the right out of Helford village, and takes his tea with his fellow-trippers in the stone kitchen of the old farm building that once was Navron House. There is something of grandeur about it even now. Part of the original quadrangle still stands, enclosing the farm-yard of to-day, and the two pillars that once formed the entrance to the house, now over-grown with ivy and encrusted with lichen, serve as props to the modern barn with its corrugated roof.</p> <p>The farm kitchen, where the tripper takes his tea, was part of Navron dining-hall, and the little half-stair, now terminating in a bricked-up wall, was the stair leading to the gallery. The rest of the house must have crumbled away, or been demolished, for the square farm-building, though handsome enough, bears little likeness to the Navron of the old prints, shaped like the letter E, and of the formal garden and the park there is no trace to-day.</p> <p>The tripper eats his split and drinks his tea, smiling upon the landscape, knowing nothing of the woman who stood there once, long ago, in another summer, who caught the gleam of the river amidst the trees, as he does, and who lifted her head to the sky and felt the sun.</p> <p>He hears the homely farm-yard noises, the clanking of pails, the lowing of cattle, the rough voices of the farmer and his son as they call to each other across the yard, but his ears are deaf to the echoes of that other time, when someone whistled softly from the dark belt of trees, his hands cupped to his mouth, and was swiftly answered by the thin, stooping figure crouching beneath the walls of the silent house, while above them the casement opened, and Dona watched and listened, her hands playing a little nameless melody upon the sill, her ringlets falling forward over her face.</p> <p>The river flows on, the trees rustle in the summer wind, and down on the mud flats the oyster-catchers stand at ebb-tide scanning the shallows for food, and the curlews cry, but the men and women of that other time are forgotten, their headstones encrusted with lichen and moss, their names indecipherable.</p> <p>To-day the cattle stamp and churn the earth over the vanished porch of Navron House, where once a man stood as the clock struck midnight, his face smiling in the dim candlelight, his drawn sword in his hand.</p> <p>In spring the farmer's children gather primroses and snowdrops in the banks above the creek, their muddy boots snapping the dead twigs and the fallen leaves of a spent summer, and the creek itself, swollen with the rains of a long winter, looks desolate and grey.</p> <p>The trees still crowd thick and darkly to the water's edge, and the moss is succulent and green upon the little quay where Dona built her fire and looked across the flames and laughed at her lover, but to-day no ship lies at anchor in the pool, with rakish masts pointing to the skies, there is no rattle of chain through the hawse hole, no rich tobacco smell upon the air, no echo of voices coming across the water in a lilting foreign tongue.</p> <p>The solitary yachtsman who leaves his yacht in the open roadstead of Helford, and goes exploring up river in his dinghy on a night in midsummer, when the night-jars call, hesitates when he comes upon the mouth of the creek, for there is something of mystery about it even now, something of enchantment. Being a stranger, the yachtsman looks back over his shoulder to the safe yacht in the roadstead, and to the broad waters of the river, and he pauses, resting on his paddles, aware suddenly of the deep silence of the creek, of its narrow twisting channel, and he feels for no reason known to him that he is an interloper, a trespasser in time. He ventures a little way along the left bank of the creek, the sound of the blades upon the water seeming over-loud and echoing oddly amongst the trees on the farther bank, and as he creeps forward the creek narrows, the trees crowd yet more thickly to the water's edge, and he feels a spell upon him, fascinating, strange, a thing of queer excitement not fully understood.</p> (20090421)</p><h2>Low Living and High Thinking at Modern Times, New York (Utopianism and Communitarianism)</h2><p>This text examines the Modern Times community which championed every kind of reform from abolitionism, women&#39;s rights and vegetarianism to hydropathy, pacifism, total abstinence and the bloomer costume. It relies on primary sources such as land deeds, census entries and eyewitness accounts.</p><p>In the mid 1800s, deep in the Long Island pine barrens, Modern Times was established as an experimental community whose members would not be bound by any government, church, constitution, or bylaws. Never more than 150 strong, set on a plat of only 90 acres, here was a haven for nonconformists. Its currency was words; its religion was discussion; its standard of conduct was unfettered individual freedom. Low Living and High Thinking at Modern Times, New York rescues this model village from obscurity and demonstrates its importance in the history of American communitarianism and social reform, especially in its pursuit of economic justice, women&#39;s rights, and free love. The first full-length study of Modern Times, Wunderlich&#39;s account offers telling portraits of this small but significant group of reformers, pioneers, freethinkers, and sexual radicals. For 13 years they tested the precepts of the founders of the community, the philosophical anarchists Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews, who advocated the sovereignty of the individual and private, but profitless enterprise. Each person lived as he or she pleased, provided this did not impair the right of another to do the same; and each traded goods and services at cost, rather than market value, enabling cash-poor pioneers to own homesteads. The community championed every kind of reform, from abolitionism, women&#39;s rights, and vegetarianism to hydropathy, pacifism, total abstinence, and the bloomer costume. Indifference to marital status and the advocacy of a free-love vanguard contributed to the community&#39;s controversial and somewhat illicit reputation. In 1864, seeking to remove themselves from the limelight, Modern Times&#39;sremaining settlers renamed the village Brentwood. Wunderlich pieces together the village, person-by-person, by relying on primary sources such as land deeds, census entries, and eyewitness accounts. He also sheds new light on Warren and Andrews, two key figures in the communitarian movement, and discusses at length such important contemporaries as Thomas and Mary Gove Nichols, Robert Owen, John Humphrey Noyes, Horace Greeley, John Stuart Mill, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George Ripley.</p><h2>Plimoth Plantation New England Cookery Book</h2><p>Traditional recipes, thoroughly updated, for flummeries, slumps, sallets, chowders, pies, and more.</p><p>A well-known food and travel writer, Malabar Hornblower has studied at the Cordon Bleu in Paris; she has published in the <i>New York Times, Conde Nast's Traveler, Town and Country,</i> and <i>Gourmet;</i> and she has been a columnist for the <i>Boston Globe.</i> She is also the author of numerous other cookbooks.Here is a classic collection of New England recipes from one of the leading outdoor museums in the country.

No one who&#x2019;d ever served with her could imagine any circumstance that would see her walking away from the Corps. <br><br>But that was before Torin learned the truth about the war the Confederation was fighting...before she&#x2019;d been declared dead and had spent time in a prison that shouldn&#x2019;t exist...before she&#x2019;d learned about the &#x201c;plastic&#x201d; beings who were really behind the war between the Confederation and the Others. That was when Torin left the military for good.<br><br>Yet she couldn&#x2019;t walk away from preserving and protecting everything the Confederation represented. Instead, ex-Gunnery Sergeant Torin Kerr drew together an elite corps of friends and allies&#x2014;some ex-Marines, some civilians with unique skills&#x2014;and together they prepared to take on covert missions that the Justice Department and the Corps could not&#x2014;or would not&#x2014;officially touch. But after their first major mission, it became obvious that covert operations were not going to be enough.<br><br>Although the war is over, the fight goes on and the Justice Department finds its regular Wardens unable to deal with violence and the people trained to use it. Ex-Gunnery Sergeant Torin Kerr has a solution: Strike Teams made up of ex-military personnel, small enough to maneuver quickly, able to work together if necessary. Justice has no choice but to implement her idea and Torin puts her team of independent contractors back into uniform. It isn&#x2019;t war, it is policing, but it often looks much the same.<br><br>When the scientists doing a preliminary archaeological dig on a Class Two planet are taken hostage, Torin&#x2019;s team is sent to free them. The problem of innocents in the line of fire is further complicated by the fact that the mercenaries holding them are a mix of Confederation and Primacy forces, and are looking for a weapon able to destroy the plastic aliens who&#x2019;d started and maintained the war.<br><br>If Torin weren&#x2019;t already torn by wanting that weapon in play, she also has to contend with the politics of peace that have added members of the Primacy&#x2014;former enemies&#x2014;to her team. Before they confront the mercenaries, Torin will have to sift through shifting loyalties as she discovers that the line between&#x201c;us&#x201d; and &#x201c;them&#x201d; is anything but straight.</p><p><b>Tanya Huff</b>&nbsp;may have left Nova Scotia at three, and has lived most of her life since in Ontario, but she still considers herself a Maritimer.

Unfortunately, if a scan�ner existed that could see through walls built to withstand both the rigors of space and an atmospheric entry, she hadn&#x2019;t been issued one. The building at the center of ev�ery new colony, the anchor, was a cross between a Marine Corps Susumi packet and a large vacuum-to-atmosphere transport. Thirty meters by twenty meters by six meters, it held everything the colony needed to get started and once emptied became a community center, a hospital, and&#x2014; if necessary&#x2014; fortress. Designed to be nearly indestructible, it was part of the Confederation&#x2019;s promise to the Younger Races that they&#x2019;d be supported as they spread out through known space. Nearly indestructible hadn&#x2019;t been enough for this particular anchor to entirely survive a Primacy landing force during the last year of the war. <br> &nbsp;<br> Although, to be fair to the anchor&#x2019;s designers and en�gineers, it also had to survive the Confederation Marine Corps retaking the colony and no one had yet come up with anything&#x2014; buildings, transportation, tech&#x2014; that was Marine proof. Marine resistant, yes. Proof, no. <br> &nbsp;<br> Again, to be fair, the anchor was in better shape than the rest of the colony.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sh&#x2019;quo Company, Torin&#x2019;s old unit, hadn&#x2019;t been part of the attack that had driven the Primacy out of Three Points, but she could read the story of the battle on the ruins and debris and she knew the weight of the senior NCO&#x2019;s vest, heavy with the number of bodies they&#x2019;d carried out. Bodies reduced to their basic components for ease of transport and stored in small metal cylinders. No Marine left behind. <br> &nbsp;<br> Her hands were steady on her KC-7, the familiar weight of the Corps primary weapon canceling the twitch toward the places on her own vest where her dead had rested. The combat vest was a recent addition to the Warden&#x2019;s uniform, as was the KC. Change came slowly to the Wardens, to the entire Confederation, but change came whether the Elder Races welcomed it or not. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not that Torin expected anyone to welcome the need for armed response teams. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Gunny, I&#x2019;ve got hostiles on the roof. Two, no three . . . moving a large rectangular crate up through the trap.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Boots on the ground, the angle kept Torin from picking up any of the action two stories up. In place on one of the re�maining rock formations that had given Three Points its name, Binti Mashona had a clear line of sight. &#x201c;Do you have a shot?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>No. They&#x2019;ve got a good idea of where I have to be, and they&#x2019;re using the crate to . . . Fuk me sideways, it&#x2019;s a mortar.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Specs flashed along the lower edge of Torin&#x2019;s visor as the mortar came on line. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, that answers a question we didn&#x2019;t give a shit about,&#x201d; Werst muttered. &#x201c;One of the dirtbags was artillery.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not likely,&#x201d; Ressk argued as Torin squeezed off two quick shots&#x2014; one to herd, one to hit. A di&#x2019;Taykan screamed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re almost in the building with them and their structural integrity was breached before we got here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The glass was broken,&#x201d; Werst interjected. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I said. If one of this lot was artillery, they&#x2019;d have known to open with the mortar.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Torin&#x2019;s team had almost reached the building, using the cover of darkness and the surrounding ruins, when the gun�runners had opened fire. They hadn&#x2019;t tripped a perimeter alert, and there&#x2019;d been no sentries set to give the alarm. They might have been spotted through a second-floor win�dow, but Torin doubted it. The response had been too fast, too accurate. For variable definitions of the word <i>accurate </i>given they had zero casualties to two gunrunners bleeding. Selling illegal weapons had taken precedence over practic�ing with them. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;I have a clear shot on the mortar, Gunny, targeting and ignition.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Can you take it out?&#x201d; <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;Please, this close I could hit it with a rock.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take the shot.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Profanity followed close behind the impact of high speed metal on metal. <br> &nbsp;<br> Ressk fired at the flicker of a shadow in one of the win�dows. &#x201c;I was hoping for an explosion.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Weren&#x2019;t we all.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Mashona fired again. <i>&#x201c;Careless. One down. The other two hauled her back inside.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Three gunrunners bleeding. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right, enough. Quick and quiet is a bust. Craig.&#x201d; <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;Torin.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Land it.

Plan B.&#x201d; Her own scanner back to neutral, her eyes readjusting to the night, Torin adjusted both her weight and her grip on her weapon, ready to run. Shifting in place, she leaned away from the spray of dirt thrown up by a missed shot. It had missed by a smaller margin than previous shots&#x2014; odds were good any ex-Marines in the anchor had begun to remember their training. On the one hand, it was about time; up until now, their aim had been embarrassing. On the other hand, as she was one of the targets they were aiming at . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> She felt the shuttle&#x2019;s approach as much as heard it, a deep hum in her bones that announced Craig was fighting gravity with everything the VTA had. The Navy surplus vacuum-to-atmosphere shuttle provided by the Justice Department had been straight up and down, sturdy enough to save their lives when it crashed, but with the flight capability of a brick. The Taykan-designed VTA they&#x2019;d acquired next was faster, significantly less sturdy, and had been built with the added feature of horizontal travel at the bottom of a gravity well. It wasn&#x2019;t an attractive feature, she noted, as the VTA came into sight, but it got the job done. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Blocking team implants in three, two, now,&#x201d; </i>Alamber an�nounced as the VTA descended toward the roof, his voice in her PCU barely audible over the roar. <i>&#x201c;Distraction in three, two . . .&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The raised metal edge crumpled under the weight, but the roof held as Craig set her down. <br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;. . . boned the bad guy, Boss.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Sergeants and above came out of the military with jaw implants, full comm units set into the bone. The Justice De�partment had provided implants for their Strike Teams, but the expense of installation and upkeep prevented most ci�vilians from using the tech. Including those civilians who used to be enlisted Marines. Odds were high that the pulse Alamber had sent over the most common military frequen�cies had knocked the fight out of the people making the decisions inside the anchor. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Move!&#x201d; Torin broke into a run, head down to protect her face from the airborne debris. Craig had brought the shuttle up on their one eighty using the anchor to block the exhaust, but it had still thrown an impressive amount of heated grit into the air. The grit would nullify the gunrun�ners&#x2019; heat imaging, had any of them managed to keep their attention on the job at hand while a few metric tons of VTA landed on the roof and their leaders writhed on the floor. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was close enough now to hear the screaming. <br> &nbsp;<br> Human, very probably male, and a Krai, no idea of gen�der. Eleven years on various battlefields had allowed her to add <i>can identify species by sounds of pain </i>to her skill set. Three years out of the Corps and it remained useful. <br> &nbsp;<br> The air lock on the narrow end of the anchor had been blown apart either by the Primacy or the Confederation or a combination of both. The reality of war meant the winner often held real estate that had been destroyed in the taking or in the retaking. The first-floor common room had long, narrow windows, an obvious entry point given the lack of glass, but the gunrunners had reinstalled the exterior shut�ters that essentially made the wall a spaceship hull. Impen�etrable to anything Torin&#x2019;s team had with them. <br> &nbsp;<br> Except . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> During destruction of the air lock, the end wall had buckled enough to twist the nearest window a centimeter off square, the shutter not entirely secure, a triangle of light visible at the upper right and lower left corners. <br> &nbsp;<br> Torin pulled the coil of wire from her vest as she ran, whipped it out to its two-meter length as she reached the anchor, dropped to one knee to slide it through the lower gap, and thumbed the release on the capacitor before shov�ing it through hard enough to clear the interior sill. Then she stood and braced her forearms against the wall. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;Distraction&#x2019;s shut down, Boss.&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;d spent part of the trip out here arguing the fine line between pain as distraction and pain for the sake of causing pain. None of them had much sympathy for the gunrunners; they spent too much time dealing with their customers. <br> &nbsp;<br> Using fingers and prehensile toes, Werst reached the second-floor window as the wire ignited. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hope they weren&#x2019;t stupid enough to store their ord�nance in the unstable corner,&#x201d; Ressk muttered as his foot gripped her shoulder. <br> &nbsp;<br> Torin hoped so too. The Justice Department insisted that property damage be kept to a minimum, and Torin didn&#x2019;t want to spend another afternoon justifying an accidental explosion. When Ressk pushed off, she caught the line Werst sent down and went up hand over hand until she could grab the windowsill and haul herself over. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Almost Krai-like,&#x201d; Ressk told her as her boots hit the floor. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can fake anything for two meters.&#x201d; Torin resettled the weight of her vest on her shoulders, swung her KC back around, and waved the two Krai toward the door. <br> &nbsp;<br> The room was still configured as a barracks, Three Points having barely moved beyond the entire colony living in the anchor when they were attacked. Given that space was large enough to keep any one system in the OutSector from having much of a strategic significance in an inter�stellar war, the Confederation had assumed the attack had been over real estate with a proportionate nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere, a gravity within specific tolerances, and read�ily available water. Turned out, the assumption had been incorrect. There&#x2019;d been no logical reason for the attack as the war had been run as a social experiment by sentient, polynumerous molecular polyhydroxide alcoholydes&#x2014; a discovery no one would have believed had Torin not got the shape-shifting, organic plastic hive mind to admit it on camera moments before they departed known space to ana�lyze the accumulated data. She&#x2019;d been cleaning up the mess they&#x2019;d left behind ever since. <br> &nbsp;<br> The second-floor hall was empty. Scanners showed two thermal signs behind the closed door of the anchor&#x2019;s infirmary&#x2014; one Human, one di&#x2019;Taykan&#x2014; and the blood that had drawn a dotted line between the stairs leading to the roof and the infirmary suggested they weren&#x2019;t doing what a Human and the most enthusiastically indiscriminate species in known space were usually doing behind a closed door. Torin pointed at the lock. Ressk moved forward, touched his slate to it, and rewrote the code. The coiled spring latches rang out as they slammed into place, metal against metal&#x2014; not a lot of what went into space could be called delicate, and that included most of the people. <br> &nbsp;<br> At the clang Torin switched her attention to the main stairs, but it seemed no one on the lower level had heard the clang over the shouting. For the most part, they were shouting about the explosion as well as someone named Ferin&#x2019;s inabil�ity to keep watch, summed up at high volume. &#x201c;. . . lazy, blind, <i>serley chrika</i>! Get your head out of your own ass!&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Two locked in the infirmary, four downstairs standing, three on the ground. All nine gunrunners accounted for. <br> &nbsp;<br> Except . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> The infirmary windows faced away from Mashona&#x2019;s po�sition. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Craig, keep an eye on the north side of the building. We&#x2019;ve got two hostiles locked in the infirmary and the odds are good the more mobile will make a run for it.&#x201d; <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;No honor among thieves?&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> She could hear the smile in his voice and answered it with one of her own. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;ve ever noticed.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Only four dirtbags left to take out.&#x201d; Werst drew his lips back off his teeth. &#x201c;Hardly worth a team effort. Want us to wait up here, Gunny?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> In answer, she started down the stairs, and they fell into position behind her. <br> &nbsp;<br> Their orders were to apprehend the gunrunners. Where apprehend meant bring them in alive or face the staggering amount of paperwork required to document every corpse. Their task made more difficult given that the people they were trying to <i>apprehend </i>shot to kill. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ferin, Yizaun, check the weapons are secure. Mack, get that shutter dogged in. Shiraz, you&#x2019;re bleeding all over the fukking floor, do something about it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who put you in charge, Harr?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Harr paused at the foot of the stairs, facing back into the community hall. &#x201c;That&#x2019;d be when those fuktards took the chief out.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Torin could see a line of blood running from the corner of his mouth where he&#x2019;d driven his teeth through his lower lip, but a Krai jawbone was one of the toughest organic sub�stances in known space and the pulse Alamber had sent through his implant had done a lot less damage than it would have to a Human or di&#x2019;Taykan. It had done enough damage, however, that Harr was on the bottom step before he noticed them pressed along the right wall. <br> &nbsp;<br> His eyes widened, his nostril ridges began to close, and Torin grabbed him around the throat, yanking him forward into the butt of Werst&#x2019;s KC. She&#x2019;d stepped out into the com�munity hall before he hit the floor. <br> &nbsp;<br> Shiraz, slumped against the wall, awkwardly trying to wrap a blood-soaked cloth tighter around her shoulder, Torin ignored. Mack, his broad back toward her, muscle straining the seams of his shirt, was going to be more of a problem. <br> &nbsp;<br> She couldn&#x2019;t shoot a man in the back. <br> &nbsp;<br> So she shot him in the back of the knee. <br> &nbsp;<br> He screamed, hit the floor, rolled, and came up holding . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> Torin had no idea what it was, but ...</p><h2>The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950-1350</h2><p><p>From our twentieth-century perspective, we tend to think of the Europe of the past as a colonizer, a series of empires that conquered lands beyond their borders and forced European cultural values on other peoples.

Reprint.</p><p>Susan Trott is the author of 16 novels. The Holy Man Trilogy is her most inspired work.Sequel to Trott's The Holy Man (1995), which hit the bestseller lists--in San Francisco--for weeks. Trott has written ten novels, including Divorcing Daddy (1992). This modest story picks up with enlightened Anna and snide husband Errol and their two small kids still at the Holy Man's retreat on a sacred mountain in an Eastern country. Joe the Holy Man, now in failing health in his mid-70s, wants to go down the mountain for the first time in 25 years and see his mentor, Chen, for a farewell visit. As it happens, Chen is 25 years younger than Joe and has built a ``Univers-City,'' where 2,500 young disciples pay to keep Chen in luxury. Joe and Anna have several minor adventures on their way to Chen, and from each Anna learns something new via Joe's wisdom. During a visit to a shop, Anne is nearly raped but learns to accept blame for putting herself in danger's way. From a cab driver with an obsession to collect rare clay pots she learns about repressed creativity. From three beggar women she learns how to help the deprived feel worthy. Anna, it turns out, also has a gift for healing. At last she and Joe meet Chen, a Chinese genius who grew up in a Cambodian monastery before becoming Joe's teacher. Chen sees Joe as a great trickster, and when Joe dies offstage as Chen is speaking to his huge student body in the Univers-City auditorium, it's an act that an astonished Chen calls Joe's greatest trick. When Chen and Anna carry the old man's sweet-smelling corpse back to his monastery for burial, Anna discovers that her abrasive husband has seemingly run off with the kids. Meanwhile, Joe's death serves to jolt Chen back to reality. All right, mildly entertaining, but clearly for the already pre-sold. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He published over two thousand sermons; his inspiring and challenging messages comprise the largest collection of work by a single author. Spurgeon preached to an estimated ten million people during his lifetime, including notables such as the prime minister of England, members of the royal family, and Florence Nightingale. He appealed constantly to his hearers to move on in the Christian faith, to allow the Lord to minister to them individually, and to be used of God to win the lost to Christ.

Known for its gentle rolling motions and intentional pauses between moves, the technique has been shown to bring extraordinary pain management results with very little pressure on the part of the therapist. <br><br>Yet until now, little has been known of the actual workings of this technique. Tom Bowen himself called it simply a "gift from God" and treated thousands of people without trying to understand the processes that drove his results. <br><br>This book fills in the gap in scientific understanding by explaining in anatomical terms what happens during a Bowen technique treatment. Author Julian Baker shows how traditional anatomy fails to fully explain the complex biomechanical relationships that make up human movement. Each move of the technique is analyzed in depth, with an emphasis on the role of fascia and connective tissue.</p><p>JULIAN BAKER has been studying the Bowen technique for more than 25 years and is one of the world&#39;s leading Bowen therapists. In 1998, he founded the European College of Bowen Studies; he developed the teaching and modular system of Bowen training in use by most Bowen schools around the world today. Since 2005, Baker has been involved in connective tissue dissection in a quest to comprehend the complexity of human movement and function.

Only Freddy, George&#x2019;s precious pig, was miserable.<br> <br>&#x201c;I feel awful,&#x201d; said George sadly as Cosmos, the world&#x2019;s greatest supercomputer, ran through his millions and billions of files to try to answer Annie&#x2019;s question about pigs. &#x201c;Freddy was so angry he wouldn&#x2019;t even look at me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He looked at <i>me</i>!&#x201d; said Annie hotly, glaring at the screen. &#x201c;I definitely saw him send me a message with his piggy eyes. It was: <i>HELP! GET ME OUT OF HERE!</i>&#x201d;<br><br>The day trip to visit Freddy at the farm just outside Foxbridge, the university town where George and Annie lived, had not been a success. When Annie&#x2019;s mom, Susan, arrived to pick them up at the end of the afternoon, she was surprised to see George red-faced and furious and Annie on the verge of tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;George! Annie!&#x201d; said Susan. &#x201c;What is the matter with the two of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Freddy!&#x201d; burst out Annie, leaping into the backseat of the car. &#x201c;He hates it at the farm.&#x201d;<br> <br>Freddy was George&#x2019;s pet pig. He had been a Christmas present from George&#x2019;s gran when he was a piglet. George&#x2019;s parents were eco-activists, which also meant they weren&#x2019;t very interested in presents. They didn&#x2019;t like the way all the discarded, broken, and unwanted toys left over from Christmas built up into huge mounds of old plastic and metal, floating across the seas, choking whales and strangling seagulls, or making mountains of ugly junk on the land.<br> <br>George&#x2019;s gran knew that if she gave George an ordinary present, his parents would give it right back, and everyone would get upset. So if he was to keep his Christmas present, she realized she would have to think of something special&#x2014;something that <i>helped</i> the planet rather than destroyed it.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s why, one cold Christmas Eve, George found a cardboard box on the doorstep. Inside it was a little pink piglet and a note from Gran saying: <i>Can you give this young pig a nice home?</i> George had been thrilled. He had a Christmas present his parents had to let him keep; and, even better, he had his very own pig.<br> <br>The problem with little pink piglets, however, is that they get bigger. Bigger and bigger, until they are enormous&#x2014;too large for the backyard of an ordinary row house with a narrow strip of land and scattered vegetables growing between the two fences separating it from the neighboring yards. But George&#x2019;s parents had kind hearts really, so Freddy, as George named the pig, had continued living in his pigsty in the backyard until he reached a gigantic size&#x2014;he was now more like a baby elephant than a pig. George didn&#x2019;t care how big Freddy got&#x2014;he was very fond of his pig and spent long hours in the yard, chatting to him or just sitting in his huge shadow, reading books about the wonders of the cosmos.<br> <br>But George&#x2019;s dad, Terence, had never really liked Freddy. Freddy was too big, too piggy, too pink, and he enjoyed dancing on Terence&#x2019;s carefully arranged vegetable plot, trampling his spinach and broccoli and munching thoughtlessly on his carrot tops. Last summer, before the twins were born, the whole family had been going away. Terence had been super-quick to find Freddy a place at a nearby children&#x2019;s petting farm, promising George that when they all got back, the pig would be able to come home.<br><br>Only this never happened. George and his parents returned from their adventures, and George&#x2019;s next-door neighbors&#x2014;the scientist Eric, his wife, Susan, and their daughter, Annie&#x2014;came back from living in America. Then George&#x2019;s mother had twin baby girls, Juno and Hera, who cried and gurgled and smiled. And then cried some more. And every time one of them stopped crying, there would be a beautiful half-second of silence. Then the other baby would start up, wailing until George thought his brain would explode and start leaking out of his ears. His mom and dad always looked stressed and tired, and George felt bad about asking them for anything at all. So once Annie came back from America, he started slipping through the hole in the back fence more and more often, until he was practically living with his friend, her crazy family, and the world&#x2019;s greatest supercomputer in the house next door.<br> <br>But it was worse for Freddy, because he never made it home at all.<br> <br>Once the baby girls were born, George&#x2019;s dad said they had enough on their hands without a great big pig taking up most of the backyard. &#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; he told George rather pompously when he protested, &#x201c;Freddy is a creature of planet Earth. He doesn&#x2019;t belong to you&#x2014;he belongs to nature.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Freddy couldn&#x2019;t even stay in his small, friendly petting farm, which had to close at the beginning of this summer vacation. Freddy&#x2014;along with the other animals there&#x2014;had been moved to a bigger place where there were unusual breeds of farm animal, and lots of visitors, especially during summer vacation. It was a bit like him and Annie moving up to middle school, George thought to himself&#x2014;going somewhere much bigger. It was a bit scary.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nature, huh!&#x201d; he snorted to himself as he remembered his dad&#x2019;s comments now. Cosmos the computer was still chewing over the complicated question of the best location in the Universe for a homeless pig. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Freddy knows he&#x2019;s a creature of planet Earth&#x2014;he just wants to be with us,&#x201d; said George.<br> <br>&#x201c;He looked so sad!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he was crying.&#x201d;<br> <br>On their trip to the farm earlier that day, George and Annie had come across Freddy lying flat on his stomach on the floor of his pig pen, legs splayed out on either side, his eyes dull and his cheeks sunken. The other pigs were trotting around, looking cheerful and healthy. The pen was spacious and airy, the farm clean, and the people that worked there friendly. But even so, Freddy seemed lost in a piggy hell of his own. George felt incredibly guilty. Summer vacation had passed and he hadn&#x2019;t done anything about getting Freddy home again. It was Annie who had suggested making the trip to the farm today, badgering her mom into driving them there and picking them up again afterward.<br><br>George and Annie had asked the workers what was wrong with Freddy. They&#x2019;d looked worried too. The vet had examined him: Freddy wasn&#x2019;t sick, she&#x2019;d said; he just seemed very unhappy, as though he was pining away. After all, he had grown up in George&#x2019;s quiet backyard, and had then moved to a small farm with just a few children coming to pet him. In the new place he was surrounded by noisy, unfamiliar animals and had lots of visitors every day: It was probably a big shock. Freddy had never lived with his fellow pigs before. He was totally unused to other animals: In fact, he considered himself more as a person than a pig. He didn&#x2019;t understand what he was doing on a farm where visitors hung over the edge of the pig pen to stare at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we take him home?&#x201d; George had asked.<br> <br>The helpers looked a little perplexed. There were lots of rules and regulations about moving animals around, and anyway, they felt that Freddy was simply too big now to live in an urban backyard. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll feel better soon!&#x201d; they reassured George. &#x201c;Just you wait and see&#x2014;next time you come to visit, it&#x2019;ll be quite different.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s been here for weeks already,&#x201d; protested George.<br> <br>The helpers either didn&#x2019;t hear or chose to ignore him.<br> <br>Annie, however, had other ideas. As soon as they got back to her house, she started making plans. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t bring Freddy back to your place,&#x201d; she said, switching on Cosmos, &#x201c;because your dad will just take him straight back to the farm. And he can&#x2019;t live here with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unfortunately George knew this was true. He looked around Eric&#x2019;s study: Cosmos was perched on the desk, on top of piles and piles of scientific papers, surrounded by wobbling towers of books, cups of half-drunk tea, and scraps of paper with important equations scrawled on them. Annie&#x2019;s dad used the supercomputer to work on his theories about the origins of the Universe. Finding a home for a pig was, it seemed, almost as difficult.<br> <br>When Annie and her family had first moved into this house, George&#x2019;s pig had made a dramatic entrance, charging through Eric&#x2019;s study, sending books flying into the air. Eric had been quite pleased, because in all the chaos Freddy had actually helped him to find a book he&#x2019;d been searching for. But these days, George and Annie both knew that Eric wouldn&#x2019;t welcome a spare pig. He had too much work to do to look after a pig.<br> <br>&#x201c;We need to find somewhere nice for Freddy,&#x201d; said Annie firmly.<br> <br><i>Ping!</i> Cosmos&#x2019;s screen came to life again and started flashing with different colored lights&#x2014;a sure sign that the great computer was pleased with himself. &#x201c;I have prepared for you a summary of the conditions within our local cosmic area and their suitability for porcine life,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Please click on each box to see a readout of your pig&#x2019;s existence on each planet within our Solar System.

These planets ended up forming two main groups: close to the Sun, where it is hot, the rocky planets; farther out, beyond Mars, the gas planets, which consist of a thick atmosphere of gas surrounding a liquid inner region with, very probably, a solid core.<br><br>Because Jupiter<br> is the largest, it<br> may have done<br> most of the<br> cleaning up<br> itself.<br><br> Step Five:<br> <br>The planets cleaned up their orbits by gobbling up any chunks of material they came across.<br> <br> Step Six:<br> <br>Hundreds of millions of years later, the planets settled into stable orbits&#x2014;the same orbits that they follow today. The bits of stuff left over ended up either in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, or much farther out beyond Pluto in the Kuiper belt.<br> <br>Are There Other Solar Systems Like Ours?<br><br>An<br> exoplanet<br> is a planet in<br> orbit around a<br> star other than<br> the Earth&#x2019;s<br> Sun.<br><br> For several hundred years astronomers suspected that other stars in the Universe might have planets in orbit around them. However, the first exoplanet was not confirmed until 1992, orbiting the corpse of a massive star. The first planet around a real, brightly shining star was discovered in 1995. Since then, more than four hundred exoplanets have been discovered&#x2014;some around stars very similar to our Sun!<br> <br> This is just the beginning. Even if only 10% of the stars in our Galaxy had planets in orbit around them, that would still mean more than <i>two hundred billion solar systems</i> within the Milky Way alone.<br> <br> Some of these may be similar to our Solar System. Others might look very different. Planets in a binary solar system, for example, might see two suns rise and set in the sky. Knowing the distance from their star to the planets&#x2014;and the size and age of the star&#x2014;helps us to calculate how likely it is that we might find life on those planets.<br> <br> Most of the exoplanets we know about in other solar systems are huge&#x2014;as big as Jupiter or larger&#x2014;mainly because those are easier to detect than smaller planets. But astronomers are beginning to discover smaller, rocky planets orbiting at the right distance from their star that might be more like planet Earth.<br> <br> In early 2011, NASA confirmed their Kepler mission had spotted an Earth-like planet around a star five hundred light-years away! At only 1.4 times the size of our home planet, this new planet, Kepler 10-b, may be the most similar to Earth we have found so far.</p><h2>The Quilter&#39;s Companion: The Complete Guide to Machine and Hand Quilting</h2><p>A one-stop reference to quilting techniques and designs uses step-by-step instructions and hundreds of photographs to spotlight the tools, tactics, fabrics, equipment, quilt design, stitching techniques, cutting styles, sashing, borders, machine quilting, and latest ideas surrounding this popular activity.</p><p>Katharine Guerrier is the author of <i>Quilting Masterclass</i> and <i>The Encyclopedia of Quilting</i> and <i>Patchwork Techniques</i>.

Richard Foster explores the riches of the historical classics of prayer as well as his own personal experience. No one who reads Prayer will remain unmoved; all will find encouragement within its pages.</p><p>There are hundreds of books on prayer, and much of the advice they contain is likely to be the same. So what distinguishes these books? Call it a kind of wisdom, a sense that here's someone who knows something of God's heart. A good example can be found in this fine book by the Quaker writer and teacher Richard Foster. The author of the bestselling <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> explores various aspects of prayer, which he defines in one place as "the human response to the perpetual outpouring of love by which God lays siege to every soul." Beginning with the simplest forms of prayer--what he calls "ordinary people bringing ... ordinary concerns to a loving and compassionate Father"--he then explores the deeper places where prayer becomes not simply petition but a way of life. He writes of prayer of adoration and rest, sacramental prayer, meditation, and contemplation, and in the final section of the book moves outward into ministry, where prayer meets the needs of the world. In each chapter Foster defines, describes, and gives helpful examples. Above all he writes with grace--in both the artistic and spiritual senses. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>"The truth of the matter is, we all come to prayer with a tangled mass of motives--altruistic <i>and</i> selfish, merciful <i>and</i> hateful, loving <i>and</i> bitter. Frankly, this side of eternity we will <i>never</i> unravel the good from the bad, the pure from the impure. But what I have come to see is that God is big enough to receive us with all our mixture. We do not have to be bright, or pure, or filled with faith, or anything. That is what grace means, and not only are we saved by grace, we live by it as well. And we pray by it."--Richard J. Foster, from <i>Prayer: Finding the Hearts True Home. <p>Bestselling author Richard J. Foster offers a warm, compelling, and sensitive primer on prayer, helping us to understand, experience, and practice it in its many forms--from the simple prayer of beginning again to unceasing prayer. He clarifies the prayer process, answers common misconceptions, and shows the way into prayers of contemplation, healing, blessing, forgiveness, and rest. </p><p>Coming to prayer is like coming home, Foster says. "Nothing feels more right, more like what we are created to be and to do. Yet at the same time we are confronted with great mysteries. Who hasn't struggled with the puzzle of unanswered prayer? Who hasn't wondered how a finite person can commune with the infinite Creator of the universe? Who hasn't questioned whether prayer isn't merely psychological manipulation after all? We do our best, of course, to answer these knotty questions but when all is said and done, there is a sense in which these mysteries remain unanswered and unanswerable... At such times we must learn to become comfortable with the mystery." </p><p>Foster shows how prayer can move us inward into personal transformation, upward toward intimacy with God, and outward to minister to others. He leads us beyond questions to a deeper understanding and practice of prayer, bringing us closer to God, to ourselves, and to our community.</p></i></p><h2>The Heritage of American Methodism</h2><p>The Heritage of American Methodism traces the grand legacy of American Methodism and shows how it became such a leading influence in the life of the nation.

Previously, he was an assistant national editor at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and a reporter and columnist with the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>. The author of four books of nonfiction and one novel, Sharkey is currently an adjunct professor of journalism at the University of Arizona. He and his wife live in Tucson.<br> &nbsp;Uncommonly trenchant account of the only known FBI agent to confess to murder. Mark Putnam's admission in June 1989 that he'd killed an informant stunned his Bureau supervisors. In previous two years on the job, Putnam had made a complex case against an interstate truck-theft ring under local police protection; busted a serial bank-robber; and amassed cocaine-trafficking evidence on a local politician. His first posting was to an obscure office in Pikeville, Kentucky, whose inhabitants included, as Sharkey (Deadly Greed, 1991, etc.) puts it, ``some of the most cantankerous and individualistic humans alive''--men and women who had to make shift with mining, drug-dealing, or welfare in order to survive. When Putnam revved up, the other Pikeville agents warned, ``Relax...this is a sleeper office nobody cares about.'' Undaunted, the young agent rode around with the local sheriff, meeting the people of the hills and hollers. Soon, a seam into local crime was opened by pretty Susan Smith, mother of two, occasional prostitute, and drug- user. Smith coveted the money that the FBI paid informants, and fingered for Putnam a bank robber hiding with her ex-husband. An intense two-year working relationship followed, with Smith romantically obsessed with the agent despite constant rebuffs. Finally, with his marriage faltering, Putnam succumbed--but he soon broke off the affair, prompting Smith to retaliate through a raging campaign of defamation. The woman finally consented to ``talk it over,'' and Putnam drove her to a deserted road where she attacked him--kicking, scratching, and biting. By the time the fight ended, Putnam had strangled Smith and rolled her body into a ravine. Telling no one, he attempted for a year to go about business as usual--but he lost weight, scratched his chest until blood ran, and became cadaverous. At last, like Raskolnikov, guilt and terror drove him to confess. Bristling with vivid characters, knuckle-biting revelations, and psychological wallop: a true-crime standout.

The reader will learn of the horrors of castration, the nature of the strange castrato voice, and the conflicts these singers experienced.<br></p><p><b>Patrick Barbier</b> is a professor at the West Catholic University in Angers. He lives in Nantes, France.<br>A remarkable topic that, unfortunately, doesn't get the nuanced handling it deserves. In a society in which the outrageous garners maximum media attention, the Baroque-era castrati should be guaranteed to lure readers other than scholars and opera fanatics. What other history can discuss sex, forced genital mutilation, religious hypocrisy, and adultery, all in the name of historical research? Incredibly, Barbier manages to make this intriguing 16th19th century European phenomenon (which involved the castration of male children before puberty to preserve the purity of their singing voices) boring, even annoying. His style is, on the whole, plodding. Particularly bothersome is his overuse of exclamation marks and his habit of asking questions and then not answering them, this despite the fact that the inquiries often go to the essence of a particular section. The chapter on the almost hysterical appeal some women felt for castrati, for instance, asks: ``Was this merely the attraction of a circus phenomenon? Was it the search by the ladies for a love-life without danger? Or the exceptional power of a voice that numbed reason and led to `the delights of paradise'? The idealisation of a `supernatural' being who belonged to both sexes without knowing the limits of either?'' Intriguing ideas. Barbier's conclusion? ``We shall never really understand the intimate motivations of each spectator, man or woman, in their relationships with the castrati.'' Which is not to say that the book is totally without redeeming features. Barbier (Opera in Paris, 18001850: A Lively History, 1995) knows his opera and is fairly thorough in touching all the important bases. As such, the book is a decent overview for people needing the basics. A lesson in how to take a great story and dull it to death.

Reprint. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>As John Cheever's stories from the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine demonstrate, in the upper-crust Northeast in midcentury, when divorce simply wasn't done, adultery was not exactly unheard of. But Lillian Ross's expos� of her own decades of adultery with her sainted boss, <i>New Yorker</i> editor William Shawn, still comes as a shock. It's doubly shocking because he was uniquely revered and had an upright if not asexual reputation and because members of the <i>New Yorker</i> family seldom spill the beans. <p> Gossip connoisseurs will gorge on Ross's tasty tidbits. As a child in Chicago, Bill Shawn narrowly escaped murder by renowned thrill killers Leopold and Loeb, who left Bill's house and kidnapped Bobby Franks instead. Bobby died and Bill became a famously shy victim of phobias--blood, violence, heights, confinement, or darkness could make him, in his own self-imploding way, go postal. When Bill's mom hired a nurse to save him from scarlet fever, the nurse "decided he needed, in addition to nursing, some sexual education. 'To my astonishment, she provided both, but I don't think it did me any harm,' Bill told me." </p><p> He was then a child of 12. It does not occur to Ross that sex might have long-term effects of any consequence. She feels zero guilt that she set up a love nest in Marlene Dietrich's old apartment 10 blocks from Shawn's family, and adopted a child, and had a phone put in by Shawn's bed, and spent Christmases with him, leaving Thanksgivings free for Shawn to spend with his wife and biological children. "Bill assured me that Cecille was going along with our arrangements. From time to time, I would think: Maybe she loves him so much she wants him to have what keeps him alive." Meow! </p><p> Mrs. Shawn, as Ved Mehta notes in his 1998 book, <i>Remembering Mr. Shawn's New Yorker</i>, was a reporter who supported her husband when they got to New York, and even got him his fateful job at the magazine, prior to devoting herself to their family. Ross got assignments from Shawn that made her famous, but she notes, "We never experienced even a moment of 'conflict of interest' problems, for the simple reason that we never had any conflict of interest.... If I wanted to see Bill in his office, I called his secretary, like everyone else." </p><p> "I have always been less inclined than most people I know to indulge in self-analysis," writes Ross. She may be a renowned reporter, but her own mind is one subject that entirely escapes her notice. </p><p> Annoyed that romantic emotions were spoiling her mood when her career took off in 1950 ("I felt I should have been having a lot of fun. Instead, I was being emotionally distracted and drained"), Ross did what any disgruntled journalist would do. She spent a year and a half at company expense in Hollywood, playing tennis with Charlie and Oona Chaplin, bonding with Bogart and Bacall, and writing the classic book <i>Picture</i> about her dear friend John Huston's movie <i>The Red Badge of Courage</i>. Ross became an A-list partygoer, the first major showbiz reporter with highbrow credentials, and Huston and company handed her a story much better than the movie in question. "I thought I was the luckiest reporter in the history of journalism," writes Ross, who may be right. And no wonder she was such a hit: cute, connected, willing to listen to egomaniacs and let subjects read her drafts before publication, Ross was, like the showbiz-titan pals of Carrie Fisher that are celebrated in her Hollywood roman � clef <i>Delusions of Grandma</i>, "ruthless and glad." </p><p> But Ross's impersonal journalism method works better with big, showy subjects such as Huston or Ernest Hemingway. Faced with the elusive Mr. Shawn, who practically had the power to cloud men's minds so that they could not see him, she fails to illuminate his heart for the reader, despite all the fascinating facts at her command. And does she know how classically, rascally masculine a lot of Shawn's lines sound? Many of them boil down to "My staff doesn't understand me." </p><p> Ross notes that William Shawn's brother Mike wrote the Doublemint ad jingle "Double Your Pleasure, Double Your Fun." William clearly doubled Lillian's fun. But with Mr. Shawn, doubleness wasn't the half of it. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>inating and beautiful memoir, the renowned New Yorker writer Lillian Ross tells a remarkable love story of the passionate life she shared for forty years with William Shawn, The New Yorker's famous editor.<br><br>"All enduring love between two people, however startling or unconventional, feels unalterable, predestined, compelling, and intrinsically normal to the couple immersed in it, so I would have to say that I had an intrinsically normal life for over four decades with William Shawn. . . . I have a lasting sense of the normalcy of it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a normalcy that Bill Shawn was able to create for himself and for me against all normal odds." <br><br>Shawn was married, yet Ross and Shawn created a home together a dozen blocks south of the Shawns' apartment, raised a child, and lived with discretion. Their lives intertwined from the 1950s until Shawn's death, in 1992. Ross describes how they met and the intense connection between them; how Shawn worked with some of the</p><h2>Jonah</h2><p>The Old Testament story catches the imagination and tells of a prophet who disobeys God and of a great fish which can swallow a man; it describes a city-wide revolt in a pagan country and a wonderfully-sighted prophet sulking in the sunshine.

The stories in <i>Years of Red Dust </i>trace the changes in modern China over fifty years&#x2014;from the early days of the Communist revolution in 1949 to the modernization movement of the late nineties&#x2014;all from the perspective of one small street in Shanghai, Red Dust Lane. From the early optimism at the end of the Chinese Civil War, through the brutality and upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, to the death of Mao, the pro-democracy movement and the riots in Tiananmen Square&#x2014;history, on both an epic and personal scale, unfolds through the bulletins posted and the lives lived in this one lane, this one corner of Shanghai.</p><p>QIU XIAOLONG is a poet, professor and author of five previous novels featuring Inspector Chen. Born and raised in Shanghai, where he was a renowned poet and translator, Qiu lives with his family in St. Louis, Missouri.Welcome to Red Dust Lane<br>(1949)<br>Now, as your would-be landlord&#x2014;to be exact, your second landlord, nifangdong&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve lived in this lane for twenty years by the end of 1949. For a new college student not yet familiar with Shanghai, looking for a place characteristic of the city, a place that is convenient, that is decent, and yet inexpensive, Red Dust is the best choice for you. For the real Shanghai life, I mean.<br>Red Dust Lane&#x2014;what a fantastic name! According to a feng shui master, there is a lot of profound learning in the choice of a name. No point in selecting insignificant words, but none in pompous words, either. The evil spirit might get envious of something too grand or good. We&#x2019;re all made of dust, which is common yet essential, and the epithet red lends a world of difference to it. All of the connotations of the color: human passion, revolution, sacrifice, vanity ...<br>You are an honest, hardworking young man, I know, so I hope you will become one of my subtenants here. Let&#x2019;s take a walk along the lane, so you can really see for yourself.<br>The first record of the lane is from the late Qing dynasty. Look at this impressive street sign written in the magnificent calligraphy of a Qing dynasty Juren&#x2014;a successful civil service examination candidate at the provincial level. After that, it was developed as part of the French concession, though not as a central part of it. Indeed, so many changes, like the white clouds in the sky&#x2014;one moment, a gray dog; the next moment, a black weasel ... Of course, now things are changing again. The Communists are advancing with flying colors and the Nationalists retreating helter-skelter. But the one thing under the sun that will never change, I assure you: this is a most marvelous lane.<br>Think about the location&#x2014;at the very center of Shanghai. To the south, the City God Temple Market, no more than fifteen minutes&#x2019; walk, where you can enjoy an amazing variety of Shanghai snacks. To the north, you can stroll along to Nanjing Road, the street-long shopping center of Shanghai. If you prefer the fancier stores on Huaihai Road, it takes no more than fifteen minutes to get there. On a summer night, you may occasionally smell the characteristic twang from the Huangpu River. Strolling around those foreign buildings lined up along the Bund, like the Hong Kong Bank or the Cathay Hotel, you may feel as if the river were flowing through you, and the heart of the city beating along with you.<br>Our lane is medium-sized with several sublanes. Another plus, I will say. The front entrance opens onto Jinling Road. There, just a block ahead, you can see the Zhonghui Mansion&#x2014;the high-rise owned by Big Brother Shen of the notorious Blue Triad, now down and out in Hong Kong. Karma. As for the back entrance of the lane, it leads into the Ninghai Food Market. In case of an unexpected visitor, you can run out in your slippers and come back with a live carp still gasping for air. In addition, there are two side entrances on Fujian Road, with a cluster of small shops and stalls. And peddlers too. Nothing can beat the location here.<br>This lane, or longtang, of Red Dust, may in itself tell you something of Shanghai history. After the Opium War, the city was forced open to the Western powers as a treaty port with areas selected as foreign concessions. The expatriates were then unable to tap the immense potential of the city, so some Chinese were allowed to move in. Soon the concession authorities had collective dwellings built for them in the designated lots. To make them convenient to manage, the houses were designed in the same architectural style, then arranged in lines like barracks, row after row, accessible to the main lane from sublanes. As in other lanes, most of the buildings in Red Dust belong to the shikumen style, the typical Shanghai two-storied house with a stone doorframe and a small courtyard. In the early concession days, a shikumen house was designed for one family, with rooms for different purposes&#x2014;wings, hall, front room, dining room, corner room, back room, attic, dark room, and tingzijian, a cubicle above the kitchen. As a result of the city housing shortage, some of the rooms were leased. Then individually subleased, with the rooms further partitioned or subdivided, so now a &#x201c;room&#x201d; is practically the space for a family. You may have heard of a comedy called 72 Families in a House, which is about such an overcrowded housing situation. Red Dust is not like that. There are no more than fifteen families in our shikumen, you have my word on it.<br>In Red Dust, people of differing social or financial status are mixed together. Small-business owners or executives take the wing or a floor, while ordinary workers choose the back room or the attic. As for the tingzijian, it usually goes to those struggling men of letters&#x2014;the tingzijian writers. They are really fantastic places for creative souls, with constant inspiration coming from the lane.<br>Indeed, your life is incredibly enriched with all the activity and interaction of the lane. You become part of the lane, and the lane, a part of you. Through the open black-painted door, you see this first-floor hall, don&#x2019;t you? It was turned into a common kitchen area long ago, with the coal stoves of a dozen or more families all squeezed in, along with pots and pans, coal briquettes, and pigeon-house-like cabinets hung on the walls. Squeezed, but not necessarily so bad. Cooking in here, you may learn the recipes of provincial cuisines from your neighbors. Coming back soaked one rainy night, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about catching a cold: a pot of ginger tea is being brewed for you on your neighbor Uncle Zhao&#x2019;s stove, and Elder Sister Wu will add a spoonful of brown sugar into the steaming hot drink. Nor will you find it monotonous scrubbing your clothes on a washboard in the courtyard, where Granny Liu or Auntie Chen will keep you informed of all the latest news of the lane. Some say Shanghainese are born wheelers and dealers. That&#x2019;s not true, but there may be something of that which comes out of the way people in Shanghai have always lived in a kind of miniature society, constantly handling relationships among close neighbors.<br>People get together a lot not only in the shikumen, but in the lane too. Their rooms being so crowded, people need to find space elsewhere. All day long, the lane is vibrant with life&#x2014;informal, relaxing, and spontaneous. In the early gray light, women will come out in their pajamas, first carrying chamber pots, then later hurrying to the food market, returning with full bamboo baskets and preparing food in the common sinks of the lane while spreading the gossip heard overnight. Men will stretch out, practicing Tai Chi outside, brewing the first pot of Dragon Well tea, singing snatches of Beijing opera, and exchanging a few words about the weather or the political weather. For lunchtime, those people at home will step out again, holding rice bowls, chatting, laughing, or exchanging a slice of fried pork for a nugget of steamed belt fish. In the evening, Red Dust gets even more exciting&#x2014;men playing chess or cards or mahjong under the lane lamp, women chatting or knitting or washing. In summer, it is so hot inside that some will take out bamboo recliners or mats. And a few even choose to sleep out in the lane&#x2014;<br>Let&#x2019;s take a turn here. Watch out for the droplets from the laundry on these bamboo poles across the sky of the lane. An American journalist once said that the colorful clothing festooned on a network of bamboo poles presents an Impressionist scene. But according to a folk belief, walking under women&#x2019;s underwear may bring bad luck. Whether you believe it or not, it can&#x2019;t hurt to take a detour. And that&#x2019;s another convenience of those sublanes. You can move through the lane a number of different ways. Here we are, coming to the front entrance of the lane.<br>Oh, look at those people gathered here, sitting on bamboo chairs, wooden stools, and holding teas, cigarettes, and paper fans. This is another special thing about the lane. The evening talk of Red Dust Lane&#x2014;Red Dust talk.<br>You may well find chess and card games and talk among neighbors in other lanes of the city. But what is going on here is truly one of a kind. Some people have moved away but still come back to Red Dust for the evening talk. It is a time-honored tradition here. Except in bad weather, a group of people always turns out for the evening conversation of the lane and about the lane.<br>Now what&#x2019;s special, you may say, about neighbors talking? Well, what makes it unique is the way they make a story out of everything, a way of seeing the world in a grain of sand. Of course, the lane residents don&#x2019;t invent stories with real heroes or heroines&#x2014;certainly not the type of &#x201c;the talented scholar and beautiful girl&#x201d; or &#x201c;un-rivaled kung fu master.&#x201d; Nor stories with conflicts or climaxes as in books. Still, our storytellers try all kinds of experiments, traditional or avant-garde, flashing back and forth, showing but not telling, sometimes narrating from a special point of view, and sometimes from all points of view.<br>Since the characters are real people, the evening talk is enhanced through its interaction with the real Red Dust life. While listening to a story, we offer interpretations from our own perspectives, and contributions too, if we happen to know something the narrator knows not. After all, a narrator is not always that reliable, what with their told or untold reasons for making an omission or alteration. The audience knows better and is capable of pulling a story to pieces and retelling it in different ways.<br>A written story inevitably comes to an end at the last page of a book, whether happily ever after or not. Nothing is like that in real life. You can put an end to your narrative one intoxicated evening, but in a few years, there will be some new development or unexpected twist. A comedy turns into a tragedy, or vice versa, which changes the meaning of the earlier story. Needless to say, sometimes we also play a part, however inadvertent or insignificant, in the stories of others, which, in turn, come to affect ours.<br>Now look at this young man sitting in the center of the group. He&#x2019;s called Old Root&#x2014;his surname is Geng, a homonym for &#x201c;root,&#x201d; and he invented the nickname for himself. According to him, &#x201c;old&#x201d; in Chinese does not necessarily refer to one&#x2019;s age; it also connotes wisdom and experience. Though in his twenties, he has an old head on his young shoulders. Self-educated, he reads books like someone swallowing dates without worrying about their pits. Like the proverb goes, the water does not have to run deep: a dragon in it will make it special. Judging from the position of his chair, he must be the storyteller for the evening.<br>Oh, there&#x2019;s a blackboard leaning against his chair. I don&#x2019;t know anything about the blackboard, but there must be something exciting about it. And sitting next to him is Four-Eyed Liu, another bookworm, who likes to give his newspaper-based interpretation to everything. And Big Hua, who is as curious as a cat. Let&#x2019;s stay here and listen here for a while. Don&#x2019;t worry about the time. If it gets late, I will buy you a night snack&#x2014;as your second landlord in Red Dust Lane.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Do you remember the opening lines of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms? After peace comes war, and after war comes peace. Things are just like that, an endless repetition in this mundane world of ours. Time rolls up and down, waves upon waves, leaving behind, on the moon-bleached beach, stories like shells. Open it, and you may find something after your heart, but if not, don&#x2019;t be too disappointed. It is only a matter of perspective that things appear to be either good or bad. In the year 1949, with the Communists in, and the Nationalists out, there are many things appearing and disappearing, like always, with the change of dynasties.<br>In the early spring days of 1949, the Nationalist government boasted of making Shanghai an oriental Stalin grad, a turning point in China&#x2019;s civil war, but to the people here it felt unreal. Shortly after Chiang Kai-shek announced his resignation, a monstrous white snake was killed by lightning in Qingpu county&#x2014;a portentous sign similar to the one at the end of the Qing dynasty. Then panic spread, after news came that the vaults of the Shanghai Bank had been emptied of their stock of bullion. My friend Cai, a waiter in Dexing Restaurant, told me something he saw with his own eyes. For several days in April, the restaurant was reserved by the top commanders of the Nationalist troops. One night, he brought a platter of sea cucumber with shrimp roe to a reserved private room, where he saw a celebrated courtesan reclining naked on the table, feeding her big toe like a fresh scallop to a four-star general, her white foot still flexing to a tune from the gramophone: &#x201c;After tonight, when will you come back?&#x201d; Dexing was a genuine Shanghai cuisine restaurant, and these Nationalists knew they could never enjoy a Shanghai banquet again. With high-ranking officials being so decadent and pessimistic, how could the Chiang dynasty not fall?<br>Well, don&#x2019;t be impatient, my Red Dust fellows. I&#x2019;m not going to give you a long lecture on the change of dynasties. I&#x2019;m coming round to the story for the evening, and to the blackboard too. It&#x2019;s just that it always takes one thing to lead to another in this world. Karma in Buddhism, or whatever you want to call it. Things are related and interrelated, though this is not so easily comprehensible to laymen like you or me.<br>Back to the story. Because of the negative propaganda about the Communists in those days, rich Shanghainese started fleeing the city by what ever means possible&#x2014;rushing to the airport, to the train station, to the harbor. Like others, in March my boss fled to Taiwan without notice, abandoning the factory. I had to find work to support myself, so I borrowed from the food market a tricycle used for shipping frozen fish bars in its trunk. With the war raging near Ningbo, the market hadn&#x2019;t had a supply of fish for days.<br>My idea was simple. As people were frantically leaving with all their belongings, transportation within the city had become a huge problem. For some, a tricycle could be the very means they needed, and that presented an opportunity for me. Also, some were getting rid of their things very cheaply. A heavy mahogany Ming-style cabinet of exquisite craftsmanship sold for a silver dollar, I heard. In fact, I myself got a radio for practically nothing. It was the chance of a lifetime&#x2014;if you had a way to carry what you found.<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Years of Red Dust by Qiu Xiaolong.<br>Copyright � 2010 by Qiu Xiaolong.<br>Published in October 2010 by St. Martin&#x2019;s Press.<br>All rights reserved.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career. He created many beloved characters in his lifetime, perhaps the most beloved among them a stuffed, overall-wearing bear named Corduroy.<br><br>Don Freeman was the author and illustrator of many popular books for children, including <i>Corduroy</i>, <i>A Pocket for Corduroy</i>, and the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Fly High, Fly Low</i>.</p><h2>Jessica and the Brat Attack (Sweet Valley Twins #29)</h2><p>Jessica Wakefield steals a baby-sitting job from her twin sister Elizabeth, leaving Elizabeth the boring job of tending the water-balloon booth at the school fair, but when Jessica&#39;s charge proves too rambunctious, she wonders whether Elizabeth will rescue her.Jessica Wakefield steals a baby-sitting job from her twin sister Elizabeth, leaving Elizabeth the boring job of tending the water-balloon booth at the school fair, but when Jessica&#39;s charges prove too rambunctuous, she wonders whether Elizabeth will rescue her</p><p></p><h2>Historical Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles</h2><p>(Revised and updated by Mark Wilson) Ramsay&#39;s series of articles examines the background of the epistles and the significance of Paul&#39;s instruction to Timothy--his son in the faith.</p><p>Sir William M.

She has been living the simple, good life in Oregon with her husband and two children for more than ten years.1<br><br>Getting Started on Living Simply with Children<br><br>For most American families, &#x201c;living simply with children&#x201d; is the ultimate oxymoron.<br><br>Between Mom and Dad working full-time jobs, the kids being shuttled from day care to lessons to sports&#x2014;wolfing down fast food along the way&#x2014;and the never-ending need to buy and spend to &#x201c;fit in&#x201d; to America&#x2019;s consumer culture, family life can indeed be incredibly complex.<br><br>But in reality, simplicity and childhood are natural counterparts. Left to their own devices, children lead down-to-earth, uncomplicated, genuine lives. This truth becomes profoundly clear when you hear an infant squeal with delight over a game of &#x201c;peekaboo.&#x201d; Or when you see the three-year-old birthday boy playing with the box instead of the battery-operated toy. You realize it when you witness the rapt expression of a kindergartner listening to a bedtime story.<br><br>As simple living mom Barbara Thomas notes, &#x201c;Children are simple creatures. We bring the complexity.&#x201d; Single mom Susan Kelly adds that &#x201c;consumerism and advertising would have us believe that children need a zillion things to have a good life, but children make the most of simple things.&#x201d;<br><br>I heard this theme over and over as I interviewed families for this book: Living simply with children is the most natural and beneficial way to raise kids, parents said. And if fami- lies chose to live on deserted islands, far away from all of the forces and pressures of our consumer culture, then living simply with children would be a breeze.<br><br>But most of us aren&#x2019;t cut off from the rest of the world. We&#x2019;re trying to live simply within a larger community that leads a much more consumeristic and frenetic existence. There- in lies the complexity.<br><br>Living simply with kids in today&#x2019;s American culture presents gigantic obstacles. Among the hurdles are:<br><br>�Marketing aimed at kids and parents, indoctrinating them with the belief that happiness can be purchased<br><br>�Age-inappropriate and violent media<br><br>�The peer pressure of a society that believes more is better<br><br>�Overscheduling of children and adults<br><br>�Practices that harm the environment and, consequently, children&#x2019;s futures<br><br>�The commercialization of schools<br><br>�The sheer excess that has become the norm in America<br><br>The purpose of this book is to help parents navigate the maze of materialism and the frenzied pace that society sets up for them and their kids. It will show parents how they can shelter their kids from the corporate culture; teach and model important values like compassion, generosity, and respect for the earth; and slow down and enjoy both quality and quantity time with their families. And it will make clear to parents that by doing these things, their kids&#x2019; childhoods will be focused on the good stuff, which of course isn&#x2019;t stuff at all.<br><br>Living Simply&#x2014;With or Without Children<br><br>Focusing on the &#x201c;good stuff&#x201d; is what simplicity is all about. Living simply&#x2014;sometimes referred to as &#x201c;downshifting&#x201d; or &#x201c;downscaling&#x201d;&#x2014;is both the means and the end to a meaningful life. A downshifter weeds out those aspects of his or her life that are of no lasting value and concentrates instead on those matters that are important. For example, a typical simplifier may consciously conclude that owning expensive cars, designer clothing, and a palatial home are not among her &#x201c;values,&#x201d; but that spending time with her family, working on worthy causes, and showing respect for people and the planet are. Simplicity will help her live with the &#x201c;good stuff&#x201d; at the forefront.<br><br>Living simply is clearly a financial means to such a life. By living simply&#x2014;and consuming less&#x2014;you can work part-time or retire early (or both!) freeing up time to focus on those things that matter most to you. Living simply is also a psychological and spiritual pathway to a more meaningful existence. Without distractions, without financial worries, our minds and hearts are released to pursue our true interests.<br><br>Simplicity is also an end in itself. A life focused on the nonmaterial aspects of existence&#x2014;family, friends, nature, social service, those things that most of us value&#x2014;is the goal of simplicity. As an end, the adoption of simple lifestyles by western megaconsumers is truly the only way we&#x2019;re going to save the planet. And living simply is also the method we must employ if we care about global economic and social justice.<br><br>A few words on what simplicity is not. It&#x2019;s not about being a penny-pinching miser. It is about consuming less, which often means saving considerable sums and/or being able to spend that money on other areas, like charitable causes, early retirement, kids, or travel. Simplicity is not about being supremely organized or having some zenlike interior decorating scheme, although mainstream media might lead you to think so. Decluttering&#x2014;getting rid of excess&#x2014;can, however, lead to a natural sort of organization. And simplicity isn&#x2019;t necessarily about an easy life. Even those who manage to retire early by simplifying, by and large devote much time and effort to volunteer work. But while they continue to work, they&#x2019;re engaged in activities that they love&#x2014;helping others, primarily&#x2014;without the stress that many Americans feel, so it&#x2019;s easier on their psyches.<br><br>Contrary to some reports, simplicity is not about deprivation. Those practicing simplicity in North America typically are quite comfortable by global standards. The only thing they&#x2019;ve given up is the unnecessary and unsatisfying excess that is common in America. In exchange, they receive the luxury of time, peace of mind, and happiness.<br><br>Because I believe that this misconception about deprivation keeps many people from simplifying, let me offer another way to look at it. The entire concept of simplicity is relative, both geographically and temporally. If a resident of a third world nation, or even one from one of the &#x201c;developing nations&#x201d;&#x2014;in other words, about 80 percent of the world&#x2019;s population&#x2014;were to visit my family&#x2019;s modest, by American standards, home, they would be in awe. Our 1,600-square-foot single-family house would stun them. Indoor plumbing! Electricity! Three bedrooms! Telephones! A refrigerator and microwave! CD player! Two computers! A VCR! A mansion of miracles!<br><br>The same thoughts would be harbored by my ancestors&#x2014;even my own parents, who grew up without most of these things.<br><br>In other words, my family&#x2019;s &#x201c;simple ways&#x201d; don&#x2019;t seem simple at all to most of the world&#x2019;s citizens. They&#x2019;d consider them opulent. And I do too, to an extent. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be able to live comfortably&#x2014;with every thing I could possibly need or want. So while some of my contemporaries in this country consider my life a bit austere&#x2014; no cell phone, an older car, simple wardrobe, no high-speed Internet connection, DVD, or Palm Pilot&#x2014;at least four-fifths of the world&#x2019;s people would be happy to trade places with me.<br><br>Simplicity, then, is about not being a typical American, because in today&#x2019;s society being an average American translates into being a consumer; indeed, a megaconsumer. That lifestyle is best described as materialism&#x2014;the belief that acquisition and wealth are the highest objectives to be sought, rather than spiritual, intellectual, and humanitarian goals&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s the opposite of simplicity.<br><br>Materialism dictates that you should try to meet your needs through the acquisition of things. It promises, at best, that happiness, acceptance, and love lie just around the corner with a bigger house, newer car, faster computer, trendier clothing.<br><br>But materialism never actually delivers on its promises. Each new purchase, latest promotion, bigger and better model, merely sets you up for the next acquisition.<br><br>At its worst, materialism ruins the natural environment, creates a situation where billions of people go without adequate resources, while a fraction at the top live in waste. And with its emphasis on things rather than people and nature, materialism robs our souls.<br><br>Simplicity is the antidote to all that materialism represents and to all of its soul-sapping, earth-exhausting consequences. Simplicity promises a life that is focused not on the unsatisfying accumulation of stuff, but on those issues, values, people, pursuits, and causes that matter most to you and that make life full and meaningful. And, unlike materialism, simplicity keeps its word.<br><br>In the final analysis, simplicity is about living our lives as we know in our hearts they were meant to be lived. This book will help you take that equation a step further and raise your children as you know in your hearts they were meant to be raised.</p><h2>The Valley of Adventure</h2><p>A trip in a plane with a family friend leads Dinah, Philip, Jack and Lucy-Ann on a thrilling treasure trail.

She is a former journalist and spent twelve years reporting for <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>. Her most recent novels include <em>I'd Know You Anywhere</em>, now available in paperback, and <em>The Most Dangerous Thing</em>, just published in hardcover. </strong> <br><br> <p><strong>Laura Lippman:</strong> Elmore Leonard's rules for writing include one that I've never agreed with: Never start a novel with the weather. Yet you use the derecho quite brilliantly in your opening and say you "always knew" that you would write about such a storm in one of your novels. Why now? How did the derecho and the right story find each other? </p> <p><strong> William Kent Krueger:</strong> The seed of an idea often comes to me long before the story itself. In 1999, a horrific storm destroyed a huge part of Minnesota's beautiful and beloved Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. When I saw the destruction first-hand, I was stunned and saddened, and I knew that someday I would write about that kind of tragedy. In thinking about <em>Northwest Angle</em>, a book I envisioned as thrilleresque in many ways, I wanted the story to open with the force of a bomb exploding, something that would shatter the O'Connor family and fling them apart. The derecho, an idea planted more than a decade earlier, became the way.</p> <p><strong> LL:</strong> You write so well about nature. I can't help wondering at the special challenges that it poses. And you seem particularly interested in humans' conflicting needs for community and isolation, family and privacy. How did you combine these themes in <em>Northwest Angle</em>?</p> <p><strong> WK:</strong> Oh my, you do ask complex questions. For me, the most intriguing part of any story is the battle between the need we have as human beings for relationship and the forces that inevitably work to separate us. At the heart of <em>Northwest Angle</em>, is the struggle of the O'Connors to come together and heal after a great tragedy in their lives. But that very personal story is couched within the context of a brutal, ideological clash of communities. It seems to me stories of suspense work best when they create conflict at both an intimate level and on a larger scale. It&#x2019;s also more fun to write that kind of story, at least for me. Your own novels, particularly your stand-alones, seem to me to be textbook examples of the dramatic tension that comes when the secrets of our private, intimate lives are cracked open for public scrutiny.</p> <p><strong> LL:</strong> It's easy to see how Cork has changed over the course of eleven books. But how have you changed as a writer? And how have the circumstances of your life changed your writing?</p> <p><strong> WK:</strong> Mostly I've grown older and, I would like to believe, wiser. Like Cork, I've become a grandfather, and that's mellowed me, I'm sure. Although my stories are still about the violence that human beings do to one another, I'm less interested in the violence itself. These days, I tend to deal more with the questions that surround an act of violence rather than the act per se. And generally speaking, the body count in each book has gone down.</p> <p><strong> LL:</strong> <em>Northwest Angle</em> works pretty seamlessly on the page, but my intuition tells me that means it wasn't an easy book to write. What were the unique challenges, if any, in writing this particular book? Did you ever feel you were as lost as Cork and Jenny? (Please say yes, or I might have to hate you a little.)</p> <p><strong>WK:</strong> At the risk of drawing your ire, the part of the story that deals with Cork and Jenny's struggle to escape the dark forces pitted against them came easily. That was all mostly movement and plot mechanics. The conflict between father and daughter that gives the story much of its punch, now that was the tricky element. And if you hate me just a little for this answer, I'll buy you a glass of wine when I see you next, just to mellow you out.</p> <p><strong> LL:</strong> I know a lot of people don't realize that genre writers are often deep into the next project when a new book is published. What's next for you?</p> <p><strong> WK:</strong> I'm at work on the next book in the series, a novel tentatively titled <em>Trickster's Point</em>. The down and dirty is that the first Native American governor of Minnesota is murdered while bow hunting with Cork O'Connor, and the arrow that kills him belongs to Cork. So you know, of course, who gets the blame. You might think of it as Cork O'Connor meets <em>All the King's Men</em>. I&#x2019;m having a ball writing this one.</p> <p><strong> LL:</strong> OK, I have a famously awful memory, but my memory is that you won the Anthony for best first novel in 1999 and promptly declared something like "I'm so excited I could throw up." Am I even close? Should I not tell that story?</p> <p><strong> WK:</strong> If I'd actually said I might throw up, this would not be a story I'd like repeated. What I really said in accepting the award was this: "Would it be too embarrassing if I broke down and cried?" Got a good laugh, though I was half serious.</p> <br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Letter from William Kent Krueger</strong> <br> <p>A couple of years ago, when Atria informed me that they were going to begin publishing my work in trade paperback with a whole new look to the series, I decided it was time to do something I'd never done before: I reread all my Cork O'Connor novels. I anticipated that in the early work I would see lots of elements that, given a chance, I'd gladly change. To my utter amazement, I fell in love with the stories all over again. What I discovered was a writer whose work I deeply enjoyed reading. And, honestly, I didn't think twice about changes I might like to make. Maybe what I appreciated most was seeing for myself how, though built of similar elements, each book was so different from the others. What I've hoped most to accomplish over the course of the series is to keep readers from feeling as if they're treading ground that&#x2019;s become drably familiar. I believe absolutely that so long as I continue to be surprised and delighted by the stories that come to me, readers will be, too.</p> <br> <strong> Profile of Cork O'Connor </strong> <br> <p>The great North Woods of Minnesota is a vast area of harsh weather, deep wilderness, and bitter conflict. This rugged and isolated landscape is home to Cork O'Connor. The former sheriff of Tamarack County, Cork is a man of tremendous resource and mixed heritage. Part Irish-American and part Ojibwe, he straddles two cultures that, more often than not, are at extreme&#x2014;sometimes violent&#x2014;odds. He&#x2019;s a family man who&#x2019;d rather toss a football with his son than tote a gun; but he understands only too well that he lives in a place where winter isn't the only thing that can kill the unwary, where wolves share the woods with predators who walk on two legs, and where, in order to protect those he loves, even a good man must be willing to do the unthinkable.</p><p></p> <p><strong>For more on the Cork O'Connor series, read Margaret Coel's guest review of <em>Vermilion Drift</em></strong>. </p>William Kent Krueger is the award-winning author of seventeen previous Cork O&#x2019;Connor novels, including <i>Tamarack County</i> and <i>Windigo Island</i>, as well as the novel <i>Ordinary Grace,</i> winner of the 2014 Edgar Award for best novel<i>. </i>He lives in the Twin Cities with his family.

In brief, this book is a copiously annotated list of Joyce's allusions in such areas as literature, philosophy, theology, history, and the fine arts. So awesome an undertaking would not have been possible without the prior work of such persons as Stuart Gilbert, Joseph Prescott, William York Tindall, M.J.C. Hodgart, Mabel Worthington, and many others. But the present list is more than a compilation of previously discovered allusions, for it contains many allusions that have never been suggested before, as well as some that have only been partially or mistakenly identified in earlier publications.<br><br>In preparing this work, the author has kept its usefulness to the reader foremost in mind. He often refreshed the reader's memory in concerning the context of an allusion, since its context, in one sense or another, is always the guide to its function in the novel. The entire list is fully cross-referenced and keyed by page and line to both the old and new Modern Library editions of <i>Ulysses</i>. In addition, the index is prepared in such a way that it indexes not only the <i>List</i> but also the novel itself.<br><br>The purpose of allusion in a literary work is essentially the same as that of all other types of metaphor -- the development and revelation of character, structure, and theme -- and, when skillfully used, it does all of these simultaneously. Joyce's use of allusion is distinguished from that of other authors not by its purposes, but by its extent and thoroughness. <i>Ulysses</i> involves dozens of allusive contexts, all continually intersecting, modifying, and qualifying one another. Here again Joyce's uniqueness and complexity lie not in his themes or characters, nor in his basic methods of developing them, but in his accepting the challenge of an Olympian use of his chosen methods. The value of this volume to Joyce scholars and students is obvious; however, its usefulness to anyone who reads <i>Ulysses</i> is as great, if not greater. It can truly be the key to this difficult but rewarding novel.<br><br></p><p>"The hunt is on, a joy for the serendipitous, and an indispensable <i>omnium gatherum</i> for the reader of <i>Ulysses</i>. . . .

For the eighteen men of Charlie Company, it was a last stand. This is the stirring combat memoir written by Ray Hildreth, one of the unit&#39;s survivors. On June 13, 1966, men of the 1st Recon Battalion, 1st Marine Division were stationed on Hill 488. Before the week was over, they would fight the battle that would make them the most highly decorated small unit in the entire history of the U.S. military, winning a Congressional Medal of Honor, four Navy Crosses, thirteen Silver Stars, and eighteen Purple Hearts -- some of them posthumously. During the early evening of June 15, a battalion of hardened North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong -- outnumbering the Americans 25-to-1 -- threw everything they had at the sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen for the rest of that terror-filled night. Every man who held the hill was either killed or wounded defending the ground with unbelievable courage and unflagging determination -- even as reinforcements were on the way. All they had to do was make it until dawn....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Life is Just a Chair of Bowlies</h2><p>Illustrations with selected quotes and rhyming text offer advice on life.</p><p></p><h2>The Silent Girl</h2><p>An idyllic white, two-storey, beautiful house in Sweden.

They stayed alongside the great flat wall of the trunk. Finger-thick spine branches sprouted from the trunk, divided endlessly into wire-thin branchlets, and ultimately flowered into foliage like green cotton, loosely spun to catch every stray beam of sunlight. Some light filtered through as green twilight.<br><br>Gavving tunneled through a universe of green cotton candy.<br><br>Hungry, he reached deep into the web of branchlets and pulled out a fistful of foliage. It tasted like fibrous spun sugar. It cured hunger, but what Gavving&#x2019;s belly wanted was meat. Even so, its taste was too fibrous . . . and the green of it was too brown, even at the edges of the tuft, where sunlight fell.<br><br>He ate it anyway and went on.<br><br>The rising howl of the wind told him he was nearly there. A minute later his head broke through into wind and sunlight.<br><br>The sunlight stabbed his eyes, still red and painful from this morning&#x2019;s allergy attack. It always got him in the eyes and sinuses. He squinted and turned his head, and sniffled, and waited while his eyes adjusted. Then, twitchy with anticipation, he looked up.<br><br>Gavving was fourteen years old, as measured by passings of the sun behind Voy. He had never been above Quinn Tuft until now.<br><br>The trunk went straight up, straight out from Voy. It seemed to go out forever, a vast brown wall that narrowed to a cylinder, to a dark line with a gentle westward curve to it, to a point at infinity&#x2014;and the point was tipped with green. The far tuft.<br><br>A cloud of brown-tinged green dropped away below him, spreading out into the main body of the tuft. Looking east, with the wind whipping his long hair forward, Gavving could see the branch emerging from its green sheath as a half-klomter of bare wood: a slender fin.<br><br>Harp&#x2019;s head popped out, and his face immediately dipped again, out of the wind. Laython next, and he did the same. Gavving waited. Presently their faces lifted. Harp&#x2019;s face was broad, with thick bones, its brutal strength half-concealed by golden beard. Laython&#x2019;s long, dark face was beginning to sprout strands of black hair.<br><br>Harp called, &#x201c;We can crawl around to lee of the trunk. East. Get out of this wind.&#x201d;<br><br>The wind blew always from the west, always at gale velocities. Laython peered windward between his fingers. He bellowed, &#x201c;Negative! How would we catch anything? Any prey would come right out of the wind!&#x201d;<br><br>Harp squirmed through the foliage to join Laython. Gavving shrugged and did the same. He would have liked a windbreak . . . and Harp, ten years older than Gavving and Laython, was nominally in charge. It seldom worked out that way.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to catch,&#x201d; Harp told them. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re here to guard the trunk. Just because there&#x2019;s a drought doesn&#x2019;t mean we can&#x2019;t have a flash flood. Suppose the tree brushed a pond?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What pond? Look around you! There&#x2019;s nothing near us. Voy is too close. Harp, you&#x2019;ve said so yourself!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The trunk blocks half our view,&#x201d; Harp said mildly.<br><br>The bright spot in the sky, the sun, was drifting below the western edge of the tuft. And in that direction were no ponds, no clouds, no drifting forests . . . nothing but blue-tinged white sky split by the white line of the Smoke Ring, and on that line, a roiled knot that must be Gold.<br><br>Looking up, out, he saw more of nothing . . . faraway streamers of cloud shaping a whorl of storm . . . a glinting fleck that might indeed have been a pond, but it seemed even more distant than the green tip of the integral tree. There would be no flood.<br><br>Gavving had been six years old when the last flood came. He remembered terror, panic, frantic haste. The tribe had burrowed east along the branch, to huddle in the thin foliage where the tuft tapered into bare wood. He remembered a roar that drowned the wind, and the mass of the branch itself shuddering endlessly. Gavving&#x2019;s father and two apprentice hunters hadn&#x2019;t been warned in time. They had been washed into the sky.<br><br>Laython started off around the trunk, but in the windward direction. He was half out of the foliage, his long arms pulling him against the wind. Harp followed. Harp had given in, as usual. Gavving snorted and moved to join them.<br><br>It was tiring. Harp must have hated it. He was using claw sandals, but he must have suffered, even so. Harp had a good brain and a facile tongue, but he was a dwarf. His torso was short and burly; his muscular arms and legs had no reach, and his toes were mere decoration. He stood less than two meters tall. The Grad had once told Gavving, &#x201c;Harp looks like the pictures of the Founders in the log. We all looked like that once.&#x201d;<br><br>Harp grinned back at him, though he was puffing. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get you some claw sandals when you&#x2019;re older.&#x201d;<br><br>Laython grinned too, superciliously, and sprinted ahead of them both. He didn&#x2019;t have to say anything. Claw sandals would only have hampered his long, prehensile toes.<br><br>Night had cut the illumination in half. Seeing was easier, with the sunglare around on the other side of Voy. The trunk was a great brown wall three klomters in circumference. Gavving looked up once and was disheartened at their lack of progress. Thereafter he kept his head bent to the wind, clawing his way across the green cotton, until he heard Laython yell.<br><br>&#x201c;Dinner!&#x201d;<br><br>A quivering black speck, a point to port of windward. Laython said, &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell what it is.&#x201d;<br><br>Harp said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s trying to miss. Looks big.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll go around the other side! Come on!&#x201d;<br><br>They crawled, fast. The quivering dot came closer. It was long and narrow and moving tail-first. The great translucent fin blurred with speed as it tried to win clear the trunk. The slender torso was slowly rotating.<br><br>The head came in view. Two eyes glittered behind the beak, one hundred and twenty degrees apart.<br><br>&#x201c;Swordbird,&#x201d; Harp decided. He stopped moving.<br><br>Laython called, &#x201c;Harp, what are you doing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody in his right mind goes after a swordbird.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s still meat! And it&#x2019;s probably starving too, this far in!&#x201d;<br><br>Harp snorted. &#x201c;Who says so? The Grad? The Grad&#x2019;s full of theory, but he doesn&#x2019;t have to hunt.&#x201d;<br><br>The swordbird&#x2019;s slow rotation exposed what should have been its third eye. What showed instead was a large, irregular, fuzzy green patch. Laython cried, &#x201c;Fluff! It&#x2019;s a head injury that got infected with fluff. The thing&#x2019;s injured, Harp!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That isn&#x2019;t an injured turkey, boy. It&#x2019;s an injured swordbird.&#x201d;<br><br>Laython was half again Harp&#x2019;s size, and the Chairman&#x2019;s son to boot. He was not easy to discipline. He wrapped long, strong fingers around Harp&#x2019;s shoulder and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll miss it if we wait here arguing! I say we go for Gold.&#x201d; And he stood up.<br><br>The wind smashed at him. He wrapped toes and one fist in branchlets, steadied himself, and semaphored his free arm. &#x201c;Hiyo! Swordbird! Meat, you copsik, meat!&#x201d;<br><br>Harp made a sound of disgust.<br><br>It would surely see him, waving in that vivid scarlet blouse. Gavving thought, hopefully, We&#x2019;ll miss it, and then it&#x2019;ll be past. But he would not show cowardice on his first hunt.<br><br>He pulled his line loose from his back. He burrowed into the foliage to pound a spike into solid wood, and moored the line to it. The middle was attached to his waist. Nobody ever risked losing his line. A hunter who fell into the sky might still find rest somewhere, if he had his line.<br><br>The creature hadn&#x2019;t seen them. Laython swore. He hurried to anchor his own line. The business end was a grapnel: hardwood from the finned end of the branch. Laython swung the grapnel round his head, yelled, and flung it out.<br><br>The swordbird must have seen, or heard. It whipped around, mouth gaping, triangular tail fluttering as it tried to gain way to starboard, to reach their side of the trunk. Starving, yes! Gavving hadn&#x2019;t grasped that a creature could see him as meat until that moment.<br><br>Harp frowned. &#x201c;It could work. If we&#x2019;re lucky it could smash itself against the trunk.&#x201d;<br><br>The swordbird seemed bigger every second: bigger than a man, bigger than a hut&#x2014;all mouth and wings and tail. The tail was a translucent membrane enclosed in a V of bone spines with serrated edges. What was it doing this far in? Swordbirds fed on creatures that fed in the drifting forests, and there were few of these, so far in toward Voy. Little enough of anything. The creature did look gaunt, Gavving thought; and there was that soft green carpet over one eye.<br><br>Fluff was a green plant parasite that grew on an animal until the animal died. It attacked humans too. Everybody got it sooner or later, some more than once. But humans had the sense to stay in shadow until the fluff withered and died.<br><br>Laython could be right. A head injury, sense of direction fouled up . . . and it was meat, a mass of meat as big as the bachelors&#x2019; longhut. It must be ravenous . . . and now it turned to face them.<br><br>An isolated mouth came toward them: an elliptical field of teeth, expanding.<br><br>Laython coiled line in frantic haste. Gavving saw Harp&#x2019;s line fly past him, and tearing himself out of his paralysis, he threw his own weapon.<br><br>The swordbird whipped around, impossibly fast, and snapped up Gavving&#x2019;s harpoon like a tidbit. Harp whooped. Gavving froze for an instant; then his toes dug into the foliage while he hauled in line. He&#x2019;d hooked it.<br><br>The creature didn&#x2019;t try to escape: it was still fluttering toward them.<br><br>Harp&#x2019;s grapnel grazed its side and passed on. Harp yanked, trying to hook the beast, and missed again. He reeled in line for another try.<br><br>Gavving was armpit-deep in branchlets and cotton, toes digging deeper, hands maintaining his deathgrip on the line. With eyes on him, he continued to behave as if he wanted contact with the killer beast. He bellowed, &#x201c;Harp, where can I hurt it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eye sockets, I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>The beast had misjudged. Its flank smashed bark from the trunk above their heads, dreadfully close. The trunk shuddered. Gavving howled in terror. Laython howled in rage and threw his grapnel ahead of it.<br><br>It grazed the swordbird&#x2019;s flank. Laython pulled hard on the line and sank the hardwood tines deep in flesh.<br><br>The swordbird&#x2019;s tail froze. Perhaps it was thinking things over, watching them with two good eyes while the wind pulled it west.<br><br>Laython&#x2019;s line went taut. Then Gavving&#x2019;s. Spine branches ripped through Gavving&#x2019;s inadequate toes. Then the immense mass of the beast had pulled him into the sky.<br><br>His own throat closed tight, but he heard Laython shriek. Laython too had been pulled loose.<br><br>Torn branchlets were still clenched in Gavving&#x2019;s toes. He looked down into the cushiony expanse of the tuft, wondering whether to let go and drop. But his line was still anchored . . . and wind was stronger than tide; it could blow him past the tuft, past the entire branch, out and away. Instead he crawled along the line, away from their predator-prey.<br><br>Laython wasn&#x2019;t retreating. He had readied his harpoon and was waiting.<br><br>The swordbird decided. Its body snapped into a curve. The serrated tail slashed effortlessly through Gavving&#x2019;s line. The swordbird flapped hard, making west now. Laython&#x2019;s line went taut; then branchlets ripped and his line pulled free. Gavving snatched for it and missed.<br><br>He might have pulled himself back to safety then, but he continued to watch.<br><br>Laython poised with spear ready, his other arm waving in circles to hold his body from turning, as the predator flapped toward him. Almost alone among the creatures of the Smoke Ring, men have no wings.<br><br>The swordbird&#x2019;s body snapped into a U. Its tail slashed Laython in half almost before he could move his spear. The beast&#x2019;s mouth snapped shut four times, and Laython was gone. Its mouth continued to work, trying to deal with Gavving&#x2019;s harpoon in its throat, as the wind carried it east.<br><br> The Scientist&#x2019;s hut was like all of Quinn Tribe&#x2019;s huts: live spine branches fashioned into a wickerwork cage. It was bigger than some, but there was no sense of luxury. The roof and walls were a clutter of paraphernalia stuck into the wickerwork: boards and turkey quills and red tuftberry dye for ink, tools for teaching, tools for science, and relics from the time before men left the stars.<br><br>The Scientist entered the hut with the air of a blind man. His hands were bloody to the elbows. He scraped at them with handfuls of foliage, talking under his breath. &#x201c;Damn, damn drillbits. They just burrow in, no way to stop them.&#x201d; He looked up. &#x201c;Grad?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Day. Who were you talking to, yourself?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He scrubbed at his arms ferociously, then hurled the wads of bloody foliage away from him. &#x201c;Martal&#x2019;s dead. A drillbit burrowed into her. I probably killed her myself, digging it out, but she&#x2019;d have died anyway . . . you can&#x2019;t leave drillbit eggs. Have you heard about the expedition?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Barely. I can&#x2019;t get anyone to tell me anything.&#x201d;<br><br>The Scientist pulled a handful of foliage from the wall and tried to scrub the scalpel clean. He hadn&#x2019;t looked at the Grad. &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>The Grad had come in a fury and grown yet angrier while waiting in an empty hut. He tried to keep that out of his voice. &#x201c;I think the Chairman&#x2019;s trying to get rid of some citizens he doesn&#x2019;t like. What I want to know is, why me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Chairman&#x2019;s a fool. He thinks science could have stopped the drought.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;re in trouble too?&#x201d; The Grad got it then. &#x201c;You blamed it on me.&#x201d;<br><br>The Scientist looked at him at last. The Grad thought he saw guilt there, but the eyes were steady. &#x201c;I let him think you were to blame, yes. Now, there are some things I want you to have&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Incredulous laughter was his answer. &#x201c;What, more gear to carry up a hundred klomters of trunk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grad . . . Jeffer. What have I told you about the tree? We&#x2019;ve studied the universe together, but the most important thing in it is the tree. Didn&#x2019;t I teach you that everything that lives has a way of staying near the Smoke Ring median, where there&#x2019;s air and water and soil?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everything but trees and men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Integral trees have a way.

The original edition of Amos Vogel's seminal book, <i>Film as a Subversive Art</i> was first published in 1974, and has been out of print since 1987. According to Vogel--founder of Cinema 16, North America's legendary film society--the book details the "accelerating worldwide trend toward a more liberated cinema, in which subjects and forms hitherto considered unthinkable or forbidden are boldly explored." So ahead of his time was Vogel that the ideas that he penned some 30 years ago are still relevant today, and readily accessible in this classic volume. Accompanied by over 300 rare film stills, <i>Film as a Subversive Art</i> analyzes how aesthetic, sexual and ideological subversives use one of the most powerful art forms of our day to exchange or manipulate our conscious and unconscious, demystify visual taboos, destroy dated cinematic forms, and undermine existing value systems and institutions. This subversion of form, as well as of content, is placed within the context of the contemporary world view of science, philosophy, and modern art, and is illuminated by a detailed examination of over 500 films, including many banned, rarely seen, or never released works.</p><p></p><h2>Raid on Qaddafi: The Untold Story of History&#39;s Longest Fighter Mission by the Pilot Who Directed It</h2><p>The pilot who directed the 1986 U.S. air attack on Libya discloses how twenty-four F-111s penetrated one of the most heavily fortified areas on the planet and brilliantly carried out the now-historic anti-terrorist raid. Reprint.</p><p>An unsparing critique of the US Air Force's role in the 1986 raid against Tripoli. A colonel who retired after 24 years, Venkus was deputy commander of the British base where the USAF's F-111Fs began and ended their 14-hour bombing mission to punish Qaddafi for sponsoring terrorist acts against American troops in Western Europe. The actual flight apart, he gained an insider's knowledge of the mid-April sortie, which was code-named ``El Dorado Canyon.'' The author has high praise for his fellow pilots and the weapons- systems operators, who carried out the lengthiest combat strike ever, pointing out that these still unidentified airmen endured the mortal perils attendant to refueling aloft in the dark of night and facing deadly defensive batteries around their target areas. Venkus looks back in some anger, however, at the political considerations that skewed preparations for the long-range assault (in which carrier-based US Navy jets also participated). He zeroes in on the top-heavy command structure and planning errors that, in his opinion, led to so-called ``collateral damage'' (i.e., civilian casualties) when ordnance missed assigned objectives. Nor, does the author applaud the risky decision to pin the hellish mission's hopes on an aircraft whose equipment has an unfortunate tendency to fail, even under test conditions. Similarly, he decries the lack of official recognition for those who took part in El Dorado Canyon. On balance, though, Venkus (who denies that killing Qaddafi was a mission priority) concludes that the raid afforded the US a short- run success. A thoroughgoing audit of a feat of arms that, for all it unique aspects, will never be more than a footnote in American military history. (Sixteen pages of photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On April 14-15, 1986, Operation El Dorado Canyon, a military retaliation raid, was carried out by the Air Force and the Navy against Libya for its connivance and collaboration in terrorist activities against the United States. Colonel Venkus commanded the Air Force component that led the attack. In a crisp manner he presents the operational details of the planning and execution of the military mission against the North African leader, Muammar Qaddafi. The considerable detail here should interest military history buffs as well as those who follow American foreign policy in the region. The author concludes that the mission was a military success despite the losses in men and aircraft. His approach to the political aftermath is somewhat more muted. He touches briefly on the theory that the real mission was to assassinate the Libyan leader. Ultimately, he attempts to justify the Air Force piggybacking onto the recent military action in the Persian Gulf. This is recommended for a broad audience.<br><i>- Sanford R.

That was the homeland of his people, the Blood Indians, but Charcoal was not free to enjoy it as his ancestors had. For millennia, they had lived each day in the company of spirits, and even with the coming of the white man that much did&nbsp;not change. <p>Major Samuel Benfield Steele of the North West Mounted Police did not know about the Indian spirit world and would not have cared to learn. In 1896 when Charcoal killed a man and made attempts on others, Steele saw him as a common murderer and vowed to chase him down.</p><p>The tale of Charcoal is well known among the Indians of southern Alberta. Their stories of his exploits agree in many ways with the official reports of the North West Mounted Police, but the two sources conflict in the reasons for the success of Charcoal and his eventual downfall.

In this book he opens up his heart, both in an exceptional interview with Bruno Monsaingeon (renowned for his documentary films), and in his own private music journals, which he kept for nearly 30 years. Richter recounts what it was like to be an &#34;artist of the people&#34;, his meetings with Russian performers and composers - Oistrakh, Rostropovich, Gilels, Prokoviev, Shostakovich - and his rise to international acclaim. The pianist&#39;s personal journals constitute an unparalleled witness to the music of our time. He notes with precision, humour and clarity, his reactions to concerts, operas, fellow musicians, even his own recordings. These are the private thoughts of a nonconformist, one of the greatest performers of the century, and one whose life was bound inextricably to the history of the USSR.</p><p><br> <p>"In these pages, we hear only Richter's distinctive voice, unpretentious, ironic, at times defensive, humorous, convincingly sincere, as brutally candid about his foibles, his performances, and his preferences as about the strengths and failings of his colleagues. A man of determined privacy who shunned interviews, he reveals himself almost inadvertently in his recollections. This book is indispensable to anyone interested in a magisterial artist like Richter. For the music lover and record collector, the appendices are extremely valuable."<b>--Beth Archer Brombert, author of <i>Eduard Manet: Rebel in a Frock Coat</i><br> </b><br> </p><br>Bruno Monsaingeon has made documentary films about Glenn Gould, Yehudi Menuhin, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, David Oistrakh and Victoria Postnikova.

In fact, as economist Liaquat Ahamed explains, it was decisions taken by a small number of central bankers that were the primary cause of the economic meltdown.<br><br>Meet the neurotic and enigmatic Montagu Norman of the Bank of England; the xenophobic and suspicious Emile Moreau of the Banque de France; the arrogant yet brilliant Hjalmar Schacht of the Reichsbank; and the dynamic Benjamin Strong of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. These men were as prominent then as Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson are in our time.<br><br><b>Lords of Finance</b> brings a fresh perspective on the origins of financial crises and an arresting reminder that its individuals who lie at the heart of global catastrophe.</p><p><br><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Liaquat Ahamed on the Economic Climate</strong> <br> <p> In December 1930, the great economist Maynard Keynes published an article in which he described the world as living in &#x201c;the shadows of one of the greatest economic catastrophes in modern history.&#x201d; The world was then 18 months into what would become the Great Depression. The stock market was down about 60%, profits had fallen in half and unemployed had climbed from 4% to about 10%.<br><br> If you take our present situation, 16 months into the current recession, we're about at the same place. The stock market is down 50 to 60 percent, profits are down 50 percent, unemployment is up from 4.5% to over 8%. <br><br> Over the next 18 months between January 1930 and July 1932 the bottom fell out of the world economy. It did so because the authorities applied the wrong medicine to what was a very sick economy. They let the banking system go under, they tried to cut the budget deficit by curbing government expenditure and raising taxes, they refused to assist the European banking system, and they even raised interest rates. It was no wonder the global economy crumbled. <br><br> Luckily with the benefit of those lessons, we now know what not to do. This time the authorities are applying the right medicine: they have cut interest rates to zero and are keeping them there, they have saved the banking system from collapse and they have introduced the largest stimulus package in history. <br><br> And yet I cannot help worrying that the world economy may yet spiral downwards. There are two areas in particular that keep me up at night. <br><br> The first is the U.S. banking system. Back in the fall, the authorities managed to prevent a financial meltdown. People are not pulling money out of banks anymore&#x2014;in fact, they are putting money in. The problem is that as a consequence of past bad loans, the banking system has lost a good part of its capital. There is no way that the economy can recover unless the banking system is recapitalized. While there are many technical issues about the best way to do this, most experts agree that it will not be done without a massive injection of public money, possibly as much as $1 trillion from you and me, the taxpayer. <br><br> At the moment tax payers are so furious at the irresponsibility of the bankers who got us into this mess that they are in no mood to support yet more money to bail out banks. It is going to take an extraordinary act of political leadership to persuade the American public that unfortunately more money is necessary to solve this crisis. <br><br> The second area that keeps me up at night is Europe. During the real estate bubble years, the 13 countries of Eastern Europe that were once part of the Soviet empire had their own bubble. They now owe a gigantic $1.3 trillion dollars, much of which they won&#x2019;t be able to pay. The burden will have to fall on the tax payers of Western Europe, especially Germany and France. <br><br> In the U.S. we at least have the national cohesion and the political machinery to get New Yorkers and Midwesterners to pay for the mistakes of Californian and Floridian homeowners or to bail out a bank based in North Carolina. There is no such mechanism in Europe. It is going to require political leadership of the highest order from the leaders of Germany and France to persuade their thrifty and prudent taxpayers to bail out foolhardy Austrian banks or Hungarian homeowners. <br><br> The Great Depression was largely caused by a failure of intellectual will&#x2014;the men in charge simply did not understand how the economy worked. The risk this time round is that a failure of political will leads us into an economic cataclysm. <br><br></p>LIAQUAT AHAMED holds degrees in economics from the Universities of Cambridge and Harvard.

The book is a manual for city-folks who want to build their own log cabin retreat, and it is written with wit and anecdotes that makes one imagine that most readers were reading and dreaming, not actually building. The book so full of opinions, rhetorical questions and ponderings that I found it a most annoying read. Like many such works of the period, the pseudo-outdoorsman tone and descriptions will ring hollow to readers today (sort of like Walden). I would never read it for fun, but it is nigh unto scripture for architectural historians studying the cabins of the well-to-do in this period.

It contains instructions for the 'complete woman' from preparing meals to brewing beer, to preventing plague and bad breath.

Compounding the difficulties of trade was the rise of the Ottoman Empire in place of the Byzantines and the outbreak of the Black Death in Europe. <br>It was roughly around this time that a period of European exploration began, and major factors that contributed to this period of exploration were introduced by the Chinese, albeit indirectly. The magnetic compass had already been developed and used by the Chinese sailors since the 12th century, although it had first been created in the 3rd century BCE as a divination device. The Song Dynasty then began using the device for land navigation in the 11th century and sailors began using it shortly after. The technology slowly spread west via Arab traders, although a case can be made for the independent European creation for the compass (Southey 1812: 210). Regardless, by the 13th century the compass had found its way to Western traders, coming at a time that trade had been increasing across Europe. <br>Trade was able to increase in Europe around the world due to more effective ships being introduced, and some of the improvements that were made to the ships were first introduced by the Chinese. The introduction of multiple mast ships and the sternpost rudders allowed the ships to travel quicker and be more maneuverable. By the start of the 15th century, ships were now much larger and able to support long distance travel with a minimum number of crew aboard. <br>With that, the Portuguese started exploring the west coast of Africa and the Atlantic under orders from Prince Henry the Navigator. At this point, Europeans had not yet been capable of navigating completely around Africa since the ships being built were not yet fully capable of being able to sail very far from the coast and navigation in open waters was difficult, but the Portuguese continued pushing down the western African coast looking for ways to bypass the Ottomans and Muslims of Africa who had been making overland trade routes difficult. In 1451, Prince Henry the Navigator helped fund and develop a new type of ship, the caravel, that featured triangular lateen sails and would be able to travel in the open ocean and sail against the wind. In 1488, Bartholomew Diaz rounded the southern tip of Africa, named the Cape of Good Hope by King John of Portugal, and entered the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic. <br>When it became clear Christopher Columbus hadn&#x2019;t landed in Asia, it was understood by everyone that this was not necessarily the route the Europeans were searching for, and the Portuguese continued to send explorers around the Cape of Good Hope in an attempt to reach the East Indies. After a two-year voyage, in 1499, Vasco da Gama had successfully reached India and returned to Portugal. <br>The Portuguese had found access to the trade regions that they had been searching for, but sailing from Portugal to India and beyond would require too many resources to travel with at once. To remedy this problem, Portugal began establishing a number of forts and trading posts along the route. The Portuguese were able to establish a fort on the west coast of India, Fort Manuel, in 1500, and in 1505 a fort was erected off the coast of Tanzania, thus beginning a trend of European colonization in Africa and Asia that would last for the next 400 years. <br>The Portuguese Empire and Africa: The History and Legacy of Portugal&#x2019;s Exploration and Colonization of the West African Coast chronicles the early efforts by the Portuguese that helped initiate the Age of Exploration, and the ramifications the colonization had across the world.</p><p></p><h2>69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess</h2><p>This is where the novel has a nervous breakdown. Anna Noon is a twenty-year-old student with a taste for perverse sex involving an enigmatic older man and a ventriloquist&#39;s dummy. Anna lives in Aberdeen, Scotland, and her sex life revolves around the ancient stone circles in the region. The sublime grandeur of the stones provides a backdrop against which Anna is able to act out her provocative psychodramas. This is a book about the body in which the carnal is a manifestation of consciousness: a book in which it is virtually impossible to distinguish the ancient from the postmodern. Drawing on literary and continental philosophy, as well as pulp appropriations, 69 Things suggests that schizophrenia may well be the only sane response to capitalism. &#34;Home is hilarious, brilliant, annoying, and ... comes up with a new and original map for inventive readers.&#34; -- Lynne Tillman &#34;Call it an anti-book, but what a strange and marvellous novel 69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess is.&#34; -- The Times (London) &#34;He is the most interesting writer to come out of England for quite a while.&#34; -- Harper&#39;s</p><p>Stewart Home was born in south London in 1962. When he was sixteen he held down a factory job for six months, an experience that led him to vow he&#39;d never work again. After dabbling in rock journalism and music, in the 80s Home switched his attention to the art world, and now writes novels as well as cultural commentary.British experimental novelist and cultural critic Home (Cunt) makes his American debut with his trademark fusion of highbrow theory and pulp pornography. Narrator Anna Noon is a randy 20-year-old living in Aberdeen, Scotland, having an affair with a mysterious older man named Alan, as well as the occasional threesome and foursome. Alan is obsessed with a cult book called 69 Things to Do with a Dead Princess, whose author claims that he was hired to secretly dispose of Princess Di's body by dragging it around Aberdeen's ancient stone circles until it decomposed. Alan tries to test the author's story by dragging a carefully weighted ventriloquist's dummy around the stone circles. In between these experiments and orgies, Alan and Anna discuss postmodern literature. Alan offers a running commentary on novelists and theorists like Kathy Acker, Francis Fukuyama and Donna Haraway, tracing the evolution of experimental writing in the postwar era and weighing in with his own critiques ("Alan didn't like [Paul] Johnson's Intellectuals.... Rather than developing an argument, Johnson simply reiterated his irrational prejudice against critical thinking in a series of poorly schematised chapters"). The contrast between these erudite lectures and the sex scenes, which Home writes in the coarse argot of porn novels-complete with dozens of colorful synonyms for the relevant anatomy-is amusing, though the joke wears thin after a while. There are bursts of vivid descriptive prose, as well as moments of demented humor (including the ventriloquist dummy's hilarious turn as narrator). Both the sex scenes and the arch commentary are occasionally tedious, but fans of Acker or Robert Coover may enjoy the metafictional conceit. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Komm, s��er Tod.</h2><p>Book by Haas, Wolf</p><p></p><h2>The Essential Rousseau (&#39;The Social Contract&#39;; &#39;Discourse on Inequality&#39;; &#39;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&#39;; &#39;The Creed of a Savoyard Priest&#39;)</h2><p>With splendid new translations, these four major works offer a superlative introduction to a&nbsp;great social philosopher whose ideas helped spark a revolution that has still not ended.<br> &nbsp;<br> Can individual freedom and social stability be reconciled?<br> What is the function of government?<br> What are the benefits and liabilities of civilization?<br> What is the original nature of man, and how can he most fully realize his potential?<br> &nbsp;<br> These were the questions that Jean-Jacques Rousseau investigated in works that helped set the stage for the French Revolution and have since stood as eloquent expressions of revolutionary views, not only in politics but also in such areas as personal lifestyles and educational practices.

Yet, today more poor people live in the suburbs than in cities themselves. In <i>Places in Need</i>, social policy expert Scott W. Allard tracks how the number of poor people living in suburbs has more than doubled over the last 25 years, with little attention from either academics or policymakers. Rising suburban poverty has not coincided with a decrease in urban poverty, meaning that solutions for reducing poverty must work in both cities and suburbs. Allard notes that because the suburban social safety net is less-developed than the urban safety net, a better understanding of suburban communities is critical for understanding and alleviating poverty in metropolitan areas.<br> <br> Using census data, administrative data from safety net programs, and interviews with nonprofit leaders in the Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas, Allard shows that poor suburban households resemble their urban counterparts in terms of labor force participation, family structure, and educational attainment. In the last few decades, suburbs have seen increases in single-parent households, decreases in the number of college graduates, and higher unemployment rates. As a result, suburban demand for safety net assistance has increased. Concerning is evidence suburban social service providers�&#x2014;which serve clients spread out over large geographical areas, and often lack the political and philanthropic support that urban nonprofit organizations can command&#x2014;do not have sufficient resources to meet the demand.<br> <br> To strengthen local safety nets, Allard argues for expanding funding and eligibility to federal programs such as SNAP and the Earned Income Tax Credit, which have proven effective in urban and suburban communities alike. He also proposes to increase the capabilities of community-based service providers through a mix of new funding and capacity-building efforts.<br> <br> <i>Places in Need</i> demonstrates why researchers, policymakers, and nonprofit leaders should focus more on the shared fate of poor urban and suburban communities. This account of suburban vulnerability amidst persistent urban poverty provides a valuable foundation for developing more effective antipoverty strategies.<br> </p></p><p>SCOTT W. ALLARD is professor of public policy at the University of Washington's Daniel J. Evans School of Public Policy and Governance. &nbsp;<p>&#x201c;Scott W. Allard is one of the nation&#x2019;s foremost experts on poverty, and&nbsp;<i>Places in Need</i>&nbsp;is a tour de force. This carefully-researched book offers more than innovative economic analysis and important lessons for social policy.&nbsp;<i>It</i>&nbsp;represents a deeply moral call to update our thinking about vulnerable people across America and rethink outdated assumptions about how to assist them. <i>Places in Need</i>&nbsp;must become required reading for anyone who seeks to understand modern American poverty, let alone begin to combat it.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;</b><b>Arthur Brooks</b><b>, </b>president, American Enterprise Institute</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<i>Places in Need</i> tells the story of how poverty has grown dramatically in suburban America due to displacement, immigration, and job loss and how the existing social safety net is ill-equipped to address this new challenge. Scott W. Allard&#x2019;s analysis expertly marshals both quantitative and qualitative data to give a nuanced account of the difficulties of meeting social needs in suburban locales. His insights and policy recommendations should be carefully studied by policymakers and social service providers as they come to grips with this new reality.&#x201d;</p><p><b>&#x2014;Paul Jargowsky, </b>Professor of Public Policy,&nbsp;Rutgers University, Camden</p></p><h2>The Light of Day</h2><p>The grand master of suspense has created an engaging thriller about a bumbling petty thief caught up in an international jewel heist. &#34;Arthur Abdel Simpson . . . is one of fiction&#39;s most delightful rogues, and his adventures provide the best Ambler entertainment in years.&#34;--Anthony Boucher, The New York Times.</p><p>8 1-hour cassettesThe Light of Day was the basis for Jules Dassin's classic film, Topkapi." <br>When Arthur Abdel Simpson first spots Harper in the Athens airport, he recognizes him as a tourist unfamiliar with city and in need of a private driver.

Yet in this fat volume of over 400 pieces, written between 1907 and 1972 roughly half when Moore was a writer for and later the editor of the prestigious magazine Dialthere's not one piece that doesn't arrest by virtue of its perspicacity, intensity and extraordinary compactness of expression. There are long reviews of such major contemporary poets as Yeats, Pound, Eliot, Williams, Cummings and Auden, plus one on Henry James; essays on a wide variety of topics including philosophy, biography, painting, linguistics and anything that caught Moore's interest, from fashion to the circus; short reviews and "notices" of books; and a bit of fiction. The hallmarks of Moore's critical style are a brilliant use of quotation, an unfailing responsiveness to the subtleties of poetic sound and sense, and an almost constant ability to surprise. This is the prose work of a poet who was, as she put it, "incurably interested in writing" and addicted to its element of "personal adventure." <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Under the Dome EXP: A Novel</h2><p>Don&#x2019;t miss the &#x201c;harrowing&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>) #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling thriller from Stephen King that inspired the hit television series, following the apocalyptic scenario of a town cut off from the rest of the world.<br><br>On an entirely normal, beautiful fall day in Chester's Mill, Maine, the town is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. Planes crash into it and fall from the sky in flaming wreckage, a gardener's hand is severed as "the dome" comes down on it, people running errands in the neighboring town are divided from their families, and cars explode on impact. No one can fathom what this barrier is, where it came from, and when -- or if -- it will go away.<br> <br>Dale Barbara, Iraq vet and now a short-order cook, finds himself teamed with a few intrepid citizens -- town newspaper owner Julia Shumway, a physician's assistant at the hospital, a select-woman, and three brave kids. Against them stands Big Jim Rennie, a politician who will stop at nothing -- even murder -- to hold the reins of power, and his son, who is keeping a horrible secret in a dark pantry. But their main adversary is the Dome itself. Because time isn't just short. It's running out.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan Reviews <em>Under the Dome</em></strong><br><br> <b>Guillermo del Toro and Chuck Hogan share their enthusiasm for Stephen King's thriller, <i>Under the Dome</i>. This pair of reviewers knows a thing or two about the art of crafting a great thriller. Del Toro is the Oscar-nominated director of international blockbuster films, including <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em> and <em>Hellboy</em>. Hogan is the author of several acclaimed novels, including <em>The Standoff</em> and <em>Prince of Thieves</em>, which won the International Association of Crime Writer's Dashiell Hammett Award in 2005. The two recently collaborated to write the bestselling horror novel, <em>The Strain</em>, the first of a proposed trilogy. Read their exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Under the Dome</i>:</b><br><br> The first thing readers might find scary about Stephen King's <i>Under The Dome</i> is its length. The second is the elaborate town map and list of characters at the front of the book (including "Dogs of Note"), which sometimes portends, you know, heavy lifting. Don't you believe it. Breathless pacing and effortless characterization are the hallmarks of King's best books, and here the writing is immersive, the suspense unrelenting. The pages turn so fast that your hand--or Kindle-clicking thumb--will barely be able to keep up. <p></p> <p> <i>You Are Here.</i> </p> <p> Nobody yarns a &#x201c;What if?&#x201d; like Stephen King. Nobody. The implausibility of a dome sealing off an entire city--a motif seen before in pulp magazines and on comic book covers--is given the most elaborate real-life alibi by crafting details, observations, and insights that make us nod silently while we read. Promotional materials reference <em>The Stand</em> in comparison, but we liken <i>Under The Dome</i> more to King's excellent novella, <em>The Mist</em>: another locked-door situation on an epic scale, a tour-de-force in which external stressors bake off the civility of a small town full of dark secrets, exposing souls both very good...and very, very bad.</p> <p> Yes, "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street," but there is so much more this time. The expansion of King&#x2019;s diorama does not simply take a one-street fable and turn it into a town, but finds new life for old archetypes, making them morally complex and attuned to our world today. It makes them relevant and affecting once again. And the beauty of it all is that the final lesson, the great insight that is gained at the end of this draining journey, is not a righteous 1950&#x2019;s sermon but an incredibly moving and simple truth. A nugget of wisdom you'll be using as soon as you turn the last page. </p> <p> <i>This Is Now.</i> </p> <p> Along the way, you get bravura writing, especially featuring the town kids, and a delicious death aria involving one of the most nefarious characters--who dies alone, but not really--as well as a few laugh-out-loud moments, and a cameo (of sorts) by none other than Jack Reacher. Indeed--whether during a much-needed comfort break, or a therapeutic hand-flexing--you may find yourself wondering, "Is this a horror novel? Or is it a thriller?" The answer, of course, is: Yes, yes, yes. </p> <p> <i>"...the blood hits the wall like it always hits the wall."</i> </p> <p> It seems impossible that, as he enters his sixth decade of publishing, the dean of dark fiction could add to his vast readership. But that is precisely what will happen...when the Dome drops.</p><p> <i>Now Go Read It. --Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan</i></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p> <p><strong>The Story Behind the Cover</strong><br>Click on image to enlarge </p><p> </p><p> The jacket concept for <i>Under the Dome</i> originated as an ambitious idea from the mind of Stephen King. The artwork is a combination of photographs, illustration and 3-D rendering. This is a departure from the direction of King's most recent illustrated covers. <br><br> In order to achieve the arresting image for this jacket, Scribner art director Rex Bonomelli had to seek out artists who could do a convincing job of creating a realistic portrayal of the town of Chester's Mill, the setting of the novel. Bonomelli found the perfect team of digital artists, based in South America and New York, whose cutting edge work had previously been devoted to advertisement campaigns. This was their first book jacket and an exciting venture for them. "They are used to working with the demands of corporate clients," says Bonomelli. "We gave them freedom and are thrilled with what they came up with." <br><br> The CGI (computer generated imagery) enhanced image looks more like something made for the big screen than for the page and is sure to make a lasting impact on King fans. <br></p><p></p> <p><strong>Meet the Characters</strong> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b>Dale Barbara</b><br>Barbie, a drifter, ex-army, walks with a burden of guilt from the time he spent in Iraq.

The stories in <i>Years of Red Dust </i>trace the changes in modern China over fifty years&#x2015;from the early days of the Communist revolution in 1949 to the modernization movement of the late nineties&#x2015;all from the perspective of one small street in Shanghai, Red Dust Lane. From the early optimism at the end of the Chinese Civil War, through the brutality and upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, to the death of Mao, the pro-democracy movement and the riots in Tiananmen Square&#x2015;history, on both an epic and personal scale, unfolds through the bulletins posted and the lives lived in this one lane, this one corner of Shanghai.</p></p><p><p>QIU XIAOLONG is a poet, professor and author of five previous novels featuring Inspector Chen. Born and raised in Shanghai, where he was a renowned poet and translator, Qiu lives with his family in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>Welcome to Red Dust Lane<br>(1949)<br>Now, as your would-be landlord&#x2014;to be exact, your second landlord, nifangdong&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve lived in this lane for twenty years by the end of 1949. For a new college student not yet familiar with Shanghai, looking for a place characteristic of the city, a place that is convenient, that is decent, and yet inexpensive, Red Dust is the best choice for you. For the real Shanghai life, I mean.<br>Red Dust Lane&#x2014;what a fantastic name! According to a feng shui master, there is a lot of profound learning in the choice of a name. No point in selecting insignificant words, but none in pompous words, either. The evil spirit might get envious of something too grand or good. We&#x2019;re all made of dust, which is common yet essential, and the epithet red lends a world of difference to it. All of the connotations of the color: human passion, revolution, sacrifice, vanity ...<br>You are an honest, hardworking young man, I know, so I hope you will become one of my subtenants here. Let&#x2019;s take a walk along the lane, so you can really see for yourself.<br>The first record of the lane is from the late Qing dynasty. Look at this impressive street sign written in the magnificent calligraphy of a Qing dynasty Juren&#x2014;a successful civil service examination candidate at the provincial level. After that, it was developed as part of the French concession, though not as a central part of it. Indeed, so many changes, like the white clouds in the sky&#x2014;one moment, a gray dog; the next moment, a black weasel ... Of course, now things are changing again. The Communists are advancing with flying colors and the Nationalists retreating helter-skelter. But the one thing under the sun that will never change, I assure you: this is a most marvelous lane.<br>Think about the location&#x2014;at the very center of Shanghai. To the south, the City God Temple Market, no more than fifteen minutes&#x2019; walk, where you can enjoy an amazing variety of Shanghai snacks. To the north, you can stroll along to Nanjing Road, the street-long shopping center of Shanghai. If you prefer the fancier stores on Huaihai Road, it takes no more than fifteen minutes to get there. On a summer night, you may occasionally smell the characteristic twang from the Huangpu River. Strolling around those foreign buildings lined up along the Bund, like the Hong Kong Bank or the Cathay Hotel, you may feel as if the river were flowing through you, and the heart of the city beating along with you.<br>Our lane is medium-sized with several sublanes. Another plus, I will say. The front entrance opens onto Jinling Road. There, just a block ahead, you can see the Zhonghui Mansion&#x2014;the high-rise owned by Big Brother Shen of the notorious Blue Triad, now down and out in Hong Kong. Karma. As for the back entrance of the lane, it leads into the Ninghai Food Market. In case of an unexpected visitor, you can run out in your slippers and come back with a live carp still gasping for air. In addition, there are two side entrances on Fujian Road, with a cluster of small shops and stalls. And peddlers too. Nothing can beat the location here.<br>This lane, or longtang, of Red Dust, may in itself tell you something of Shanghai history. After the Opium War, the city was forced open to the Western powers as a treaty port with areas selected as foreign concessions. The expatriates were then unable to tap the immense potential of the city, so some Chinese were allowed to move in. Soon the concession authorities had collective dwellings built for them in the designated lots. To make them convenient to manage, the houses were designed in the same architectural style, then arranged in lines like barracks, row after row, accessible to the main lane from sublanes. As in other lanes, most of the buildings in Red Dust belong to the shikumen style, the typical Shanghai two-storied house with a stone doorframe and a small courtyard. In the early concession days, a shikumen house was designed for one family, with rooms for different purposes&#x2014;wings, hall, front room, dining room, corner room, back room, attic, dark room, and tingzijian, a cubicle above the kitchen. As a result of the city housing shortage, some of the rooms were leased. Then individually subleased, with the rooms further partitioned or subdivided, so now a &#x201c;room&#x201d; is practically the space for a family. You may have heard of a comedy called 72 Families in a House, which is about such an overcrowded housing situation. Red Dust is not like that. There are no more than fifteen families in our shikumen, you have my word on it.<br>In Red Dust, people of differing social or financial status are mixed together. Small-business owners or executives take the wing or a floor, while ordinary workers choose the back room or the attic. As for the tingzijian, it usually goes to those struggling men of letters&#x2014;the tingzijian writers. They are really fantastic places for creative souls, with constant inspiration coming from the lane.<br>Indeed, your life is incredibly enriched with all the activity and interaction of the lane. You become part of the lane, and the lane, a part of you. Through the open black-painted door, you see this first-floor hall, don&#x2019;t you? It was turned into a common kitchen area long ago, with the coal stoves of a dozen or more families all squeezed in, along with pots and pans, coal briquettes, and pigeon-house-like cabinets hung on the walls. Squeezed, but not necessarily so bad. Cooking in here, you may learn the recipes of provincial cuisines from your neighbors. Coming back soaked one rainy night, you don&#x2019;t have to worry about catching a cold: a pot of ginger tea is being brewed for you on your neighbor Uncle Zhao&#x2019;s stove, and Elder Sister Wu will add a spoonful of brown sugar into the steaming hot drink. Nor will you find it monotonous scrubbing your clothes on a washboard in the courtyard, where Granny Liu or Auntie Chen will keep you informed of all the latest news of the lane. Some say Shanghainese are born wheelers and dealers. That&#x2019;s not true, but there may be something of that which comes out of the way people in Shanghai have always lived in a kind of miniature society, constantly handling relationships among close neighbors.<br>People get together a lot not only in the shikumen, but in the lane too. Their rooms being so crowded, people need to find space elsewhere. All day long, the lane is vibrant with life&#x2014;informal, relaxing, and spontaneous. In the early gray light, women will come out in their pajamas, first carrying chamber pots, then later hurrying to the food market, returning with full bamboo baskets and preparing food in the common sinks of the lane while spreading the gossip heard overnight. Men will stretch out, practicing Tai Chi outside, brewing the first pot of Dragon Well tea, singing snatches of Beijing opera, and exchanging a few words about the weather or the political weather. For lunchtime, those people at home will step out again, holding rice bowls, chatting, laughing, or exchanging a slice of fried pork for a nugget of steamed belt fish. In the evening, Red Dust gets even more exciting&#x2014;men playing chess or cards or mahjong under the lane lamp, women chatting or knitting or washing. In summer, it is so hot inside that some will take out bamboo recliners or mats. And a few even choose to sleep out in the lane&#x2014;<br>Let&#x2019;s take a turn here. Watch out for the droplets from the laundry on these bamboo poles across the sky of the lane. An American journalist once said that the colorful clothing festooned on a network of bamboo poles presents an Impressionist scene. But according to a folk belief, walking under women&#x2019;s underwear may bring bad luck. Whether you believe it or not, it can&#x2019;t hurt to take a detour. And that&#x2019;s another convenience of those sublanes. You can move through the lane a number of different ways. Here we are, coming to the front entrance of the lane.<br>Oh, look at those people gathered here, sitting on bamboo chairs, wooden stools, and holding teas, cigarettes, and paper fans. This is another special thing about the lane. The evening talk of Red Dust Lane&#x2014;Red Dust talk.<br>You may well find chess and card games and talk among neighbors in other lanes of the city. But what is going on here is truly one of a kind. Some people have moved away but still come back to Red Dust for the evening talk. It is a time-honored tradition here. Except in bad weather, a group of people always turns out for the evening conversation of the lane and about the lane.<br>Now what&#x2019;s special, you may say, about neighbors talking? Well, what makes it unique is the way they make a story out of everything, a way of seeing the world in a grain of sand. Of course, the lane residents don&#x2019;t invent stories with real heroes or heroines&#x2014;certainly not the type of &#x201c;the talented scholar and beautiful girl&#x201d; or &#x201c;un-rivaled kung fu master.&#x201d; Nor stories with conflicts or climaxes as in books. Still, our storytellers try all kinds of experiments, traditional or avant-garde, flashing back and forth, showing but not telling, sometimes narrating from a special point of view, and sometimes from all points of view.<br>Since the characters are real people, the evening talk is enhanced through its interaction with the real Red Dust life. While listening to a story, we offer interpretations from our own perspectives, and contributions too, if we happen to know something the narrator knows not. After all, a narrator is not always that reliable, what with their told or untold reasons for making an omission or alteration. The audience knows better and is capable of pulling a story to pieces and retelling it in different ways.<br>A written story inevitably comes to an end at the last page of a book, whether happily ever after or not. Nothing is like that in real life. You can put an end to your narrative one intoxicated evening, but in a few years, there will be some new development or unexpected twist. A comedy turns into a tragedy, or vice versa, which changes the m...</p><h2>The New Maiolica: Contemporary Approaches to Color and Technique</h2><p><p>Selected by <i>Choice</i> magazine as an Outstanding Academic Book for 2000</p><p>The practice of tin glaze spans thousands of years of history, from its inception in Mesopotamia, through its flowering in Islamic culture, its brilliant heyday during the Italian Renaissance, and its current active revival around the world. It has always been a medium both varied and expressive that has inspired ceramists and artists alike over the centuries to ply their brushes in an exuberance of painted decoration and narrative. Within the field of ceramics, maiolica, with its stable color-holding glaze surface, is unique as a medium&#x2014;indeed, it has been called a painter's medium.</p><p><i>The New Maiolica</i> is conceived by Matthias Ostermann as a workshop in print, guiding the reader progressively through some of the conceptual, material, and technical concerns that inform this versatile and compelling medium.</p><p>The work of more than fifty international ceramists is shown, giving evidence to the great variety of contemporary expression in tin glaze. There is also an examination of the problems that can occur in maiolica production, and suggested solutions, followed by a list of recommended reading, with food for philosophical, aesthetic, and technical thought.</p></p><p>Matthias Ostermann has been a practicing ceramist since 1974 and has exhibited internationally. His work can be found in such permanent collections as the Baden-Wurtenbergisches Landesmuseum in Germany, the Canadian Clay and Glass Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. He resides in Toronto.<p>"The author has conceived this volume to serve as a methodology in the practice of tin glaze ceramics. It is an all-inclusive work covering many important areas such as terminology, aesthetics, materials used, and procedural steps involved in application and troubleshooting. . . .

For 35 years, the country has become vastly wealthier, but most people have not. For the top 1%, and even more forthe top 0.1%, the last 35 years have been a bonanza.Canadians know very well that there&#39;s a huge problem. It&#39;s expressed in resistance to tax increases, concerns over unaffordable housing, demands for higher minimum wages, and pressure for action on the lack of good full time jobs for new graduates.This book documents the dramatic and rapid growth in inequality. It identifies the causes. And it proposes meaningful steps to halt and reverse this dangerous trend.Lars Osberg looks separately at the top, middle and bottom of Canadian incomes. He provides new data which will surprise, even shock, many readers. He explains how trade deals have contributed to putting a lid on incomes for workers. The gradual decline of unions in the private sector has also been a factor. On the other end of the scale, he explains the growing high salaries for corporate executives, managers, and some fortunate professionals. Lars Osberg believes that increasing inequality is bad for the country, and its unfairness is toxic to public life. But there is nothing inevitable about this, and he points to innovative measures that would produce a fairer distribution of wealth among all Canadians.</p><p>LARS OSBERG is a Professor of Economics at Dalhousie University with research interests in labour economics and income and wealth distribution. He received his PhD in Economics from Yale University and has published numerous articles in academic journals and seven books, including Lorimer&#39;s Unnecessary Debts, co-edited with Pierre Fortin. He is a past President of the Canadian Economics Association."Lars Osberg convincingly argues that ever rising inequality is literally unsustainable since it undermines economic stability and steadily tears away at the social and political fabric. He carefully details the inequality story in Canada, stressing the accumulation of income and wealth in the hands of the top one per cent, the long term stagnation of the living standards of the middle class, and the exclusion of the poor from the mainstream. His rigorous and humane analysis sets the stage for some radical, but feasible, advice on where we should go from here." (Andrew Jackson, Broadbent Institute's Senior Policy Advisor, Chief Economist and Director of Social and Economic Policy with the Canadian Labour Congress)<br><br>"When Lars Osberg decides it's time to take another look at trends in income inequality, I always sit up and pay close attention. The former president of the Canadian Economics Association has been a guru on the topic for decades, both in Canada and internationally. His scholarship and fabulous talents as raconteur never fail to impart fresh insights on the most important socio-economic subject of our era, and clarify exactly why income inequality has taken on that urgent status. If you want to know how we got here and where we're headed, Osberg's latest is sure to be the best-in-class book on a topic of profound relevance in the early 21st century: how our economic fates are bound with one another's." (Armine Yalnizyan, Economic Policy Advisor to the Government of Canada (Employment and Social Development Canada))<br><br>"Nobody in Canada, and few anywhere in the world, have done more than Lars Osberg to focus public debate and public policy on the crucial challenge of combating and reducing inequality. Now this readable, rigorous book assembles his most powerful arguments under one cover. It is a potent weapon in the shared effort to build a more equal Canada." (Jim Stanford, Director, Centre for Future Work, Sydney Australia)<br><br>"If you think "relentless incrementalism" is, or should be, the Canadian way, this book is a reality check. Our accelerating path towards steeper inequality, profound insecurity and social unrest does not lead to the future Canada we want. Osberg's call for policies that are bold and fast enough to change paths, like basic income and fairer taxation, ought to be heeded." (Sheila Regehr, Basic Income Canada Network)<br><br>"Lars Osberg has long been a leading voice alerting us to the explosive growth in the gap between the rich and the rest of Canadian society. In this important and incisive book, he lays out the negative impacts of such inequality and the bold steps needed if we are to address the problem before our country becomes unrecognizable." (Linda McQuaig, Journalist and co-author of <i>The Trouble with Billionaires</i>)<br><br>"This is a timely and important book on arguably the most crucial policy challenge facing governments today: the incessant growth of inequality. Lars Osberg provides a reasoned, yet compassionate, account of inequality in Canada and the policy challenges it entails, and he does so in a highly readable way. He carefully documents the growth in income inequality; explains its sources, especially the growth of incomes at the top combined with stagnation of middle and lower incomes; outlines its consequences for Canadian economic and social well-being; warns about trends likely to exacerbate the problem in the near future; and advocates a set of policies to address the issue. This is a first-class account by a first-class progressive thinker. The approach is balanced but incisive, and the multi-faceted remedies are both realistic and compelling. The arguments deserve to be heeded by concerned citizens, policy makers and scholars alike."

Using local party records, oral histories, union records, party newspapers, and government documents, Randi Storch fills the gap between Leninist principles and the day-to-day activities of Chicago's rank-and-file Communists.</p><p>Uncovering rich new evidence from Moscow's former party archive, Storch argues that although the American Communist Party was an international organization strongly influenced by the Soviet Union, at the city level it was a more vibrant and flexible organization responsible to local needs and concerns. Thus, while working for a better welfare system, fairer unions, and racial equality, Chicago's Communists created a movement that at times departed from international party leaders' intentions. By focusing on the experience of Chicago's Communists, who included a large working-class, African American, and ethnic population, this study reexamines party members' actions as an integral part of the communities and industries in which they lived and worked.</p></p><p><b>Randi Storch</b> is an associate professor of history at the State University of New York College at Cortland.<p>"Storch's new book effectively kicks off the beginning of a new wave of American Communist Party historiography. . . .

Because the background for this fifth published novel was a strike of migrant pickers in California&#x2019;s apple orchards, it was assumed to be one of the &#x201c;proletarian&#x201d; novels of the period supporting radical causes if not actually promoting the changing line of the Communist Party. The powerful California growers&#x2019; associations that he attacked suspected him of being a card-carrying contributor to the &#x201c;red conspiracy&#x201d; that had been viewed as a threat to American traditions since World War I.</p><p>Steinbeck wrote to a friend, however, just after completing the novel, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like communists, either. I mean I dislike them as people. I rather imagine the apostles had the same waspish qualities and the New Testament is proof that they had equally bad manners&#x201d;&#x2014;an attitude that he maintained throughout his life.* Earlier he had written to another struggling novelist, George Albee: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in strikes as a means of raising men&#x2019;s wages, and I&#x2019;m not interested in ranting about justice and oppression, mere outcroppings which indicate the condition....The book is brutal. I wanted to be merely a recording consciousness, judging nothing, simply putting down the thing.&#x201d; Readers will discover that he could not maintain such a detached perspective; yet at a time when the world raged with fanatical struggles between &#x201c;true believers,&#x201d; he was successful in refusing to serve any organized party or special interest group and becoming an ideologue.</p><p>Ironically, the first controversy over <i>In Dubious Battle</i> was generated not by conservative critics who would later be outraged by <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> but by a radical sympathizer in New York who almost destroyed the rewarding association that Steinbeck had just begun to enjoy with publisher Pascal Covici. Their collaboration looked to promise Steinbeck the security and recognition that he had been seeking since 1929.</p><p>Steinbeck had decided to become a professional writer when he entered high school at the age of fifteen in his home town of Salinas, California; but before he emerged from obscurity and attained international celebrity, he had to survive a long, frustrating apprenticeship. His first novel, <i>Cup of Gold</i>, a swashbuckling tale of the Spanish Main, was not published until he was twenty-seven&#x2014;in October 1929, just weeks before the stock market crash brought on the Great Depression. Written in an affected style influenced by such now-forgotten favorites of the flamboyant 1920s as Donn-Byrne&#x2019;s <i>Messer Marco Polo</i>, Rafael Sabatini&#x2019;s <i>Captain Blood</i> and James Branch Cabell&#x2019;s scandalous <i>Jurgen</i>, this historical romance enjoyed a modest, shortlived run, but it quickly disappeared from the market when the publisher became one of the many bankruptcy victims of the time. Steinbeck&#x2019;s next two works&#x2014;<i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> (1932), a story-cycle set in his native region of contemporary California, and a mystical fantasy called <i>To a God Unknown</i> (1933)&#x2014;followed the same route, along with their publishers.</p><p>Steinbeck had completed a fourth novel, <i>Tortilla Flat</i>, which was circulating among publishers without success, and was already deeply engaged on another, which would become <i>In Dubious Battle</i>, when late in 1933, Ben Abramson, proprietor of Chicago&#x2019;s Argus Bookshop and an enthusiastic advocate of Steinbeck&#x2019;s work, pressed a copy of <i>The Pastures of Heaven</i> on Pascal Covici, partner in the New York publishing firm Covici-Friede, Inc. Covici, who had never before heard of Steinbeck, shared Abramson&#x2019;s enthusiasm and sat up all night reading the ironic short-story cycle. He had Steinbeck&#x2019;s agent send him the manuscript of <i>Tortilla Flat</i> and at once offered to publish this droll cycle of stories about Mexican-Americans leading a scandalously marginal life in the semi-wooded outskirts of Monterey, California. Covici took an option on Steinbeck&#x2019;s future works and promised to reissue the earlier novels. At last, things seemed to have turned around for Steinbeck.</p><p>Unfortunately, the manuscript of <i>In Dubious Battle</i> arrived at Covici&#x2019;s office while the publisher was out of town promoting <i>Tortilla Flat.</i> The manuscript fell into the hands of an editor with communist sympathies who rejected it because he considered the marxist ideology of the strike organizers inaccurate. He felt that Steinbeck did not know what he was talking about and that the novel would offend people at both ends of the political spectrum.</p><p>The rejection invalidated Steinbeck&#x2019;s contract with Covici and infuriated the author, who wrote to his agent:</p><p></p><p>Between you and me I suspect a strong communist bias in that office, since the reasons given against the book are all those I have heard from communists of the intellectual bent and of the Jewish race....My information for this book came mostly from Irish and Italian communists whose training was in the field, not in the drawing room. They don&#x2019;t believe in ideologies and ideal tactics.</p><p></p><p>While Steinbeck felt only contempt for those he called New York &#x201c;parlor pinks,&#x201d; <i>In Dubious Battle</i> attracted a number of bids from other publishers. When an outraged Covici learned what had happened, he fired the editor and wrote to Steinbeck offering to publish the novel at once. The author decided to stay with Covici, and they worked together for the rest of Steinbeck&#x2019;s life.</p><p>Steinbeck placed such great emphasis on his sources and the accuracy of their firsthand information because he had originally planned this book, based on the experiences of strike leader Pat Chambers, to be a first-person diary of a labor organizer working in the field. His literary agents, however, suggested that he use the material as the basis for a novel instead, as it would probably prove more popular with his new audience, as well as less likely to cause trouble with possibly offended parties on both sides of the disputes. Excited about the project, Steinbeck turned out 120,000 words in five months, beginning early in September 1934, only weeks after the notorious Bloody Thursday (mentioned several times in the text), July 5, 1934, when San Francisco police made international headlines by shooting two people and wounding many others in an effort to break up a longshoremen&#x2019;s strike. The eyes of the world were on the turbulent scene in California for another reason: social-protest novelist Upton Sinclair was conducting a strident campaign for the state&#x2019;s governorship based on his EPIC (End Poverty in California) share-the-wealth plan.</p><p>When <i>In Dubious Battle</i> was published in 1936, Steinbeck was surprised that this novel, which he had thought most readers would find objectionably grim and controversial, reached the best-seller lists. It also received surprisingly few hostile reviews from critics on either the political right or left. The most conspicuous exception to this favorable consensus was Mary McCarthy&#x2019;s denunciation of the novel as &#x201c;academic, wooden, inert&#x201d; and of Steinbeck as &#x201c;certainly no philosopher, sociologist, or strike technician.&#x201d; She was then a recent Vassar graduate writing for <i>The Nation</i> and would not publish the first of her own chicly cynical satires until 1942; but her attitude started a feud that lasted the rest of Steinbeck&#x2019;s life.</p><p>II</p><p>Despite the unforeseen success of the novel, Steinbeck remained annoyed that the interest in it was mostly political, as indeed he had predicted. Readers&#x2019; attention focused upon what the author considered &#x201c;mere outcroppings&#x201d;&#x2014;like local strikes&#x2014;rather than what he considered the underlying problems of human greed and inhumane behavior toward other humans as a result of lack of understanding. The situation in California, however, where entrenched interests looked upon themselves as defending the last frontier in &#x201c;the land of opportunity,&#x201d; seemed to a worried world to be verging on class warfare.</p><p>Steinbeck does not appear to have taken much interest in Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s gubernatorial campaign, nor was he particularly familiar with the reformer&#x2019;s many fictional expos�s of corruption in American industry. Sinclair&#x2019;s lurid but often pedestrianly written naturalism was probably the kind of &#x201c;realism&#x201d; that Steinbeck often objected to in letters to his friends during the 1930s, when he continued to speak of his own predilection for fantasy and the &#x201c;metaphysical.&#x201d; Steinbeck sought to probe beneath the superficialities of partisan contentiousness, but readers were moved by his emotionally powerful rendering of violent episodes in the world around them. Two such episodes evoked in the novel would still have been fresh in readers&#x2019; minds when it appeared.</p><p>The older and most fanatical characters in the novel, like old Joy, are surviving &#x201c;Wobblies,&#x201d; members of the radical Industrial Workers of the World (or IWW), organized in 1905 when the craft-oriented American Federation of Labor seemed insufficiently concerned about unskilled manual laborers. Despite the IWW&#x2019;s insistence that it was not a syndicalist organization advocating violent overthrow of governments, it was widely suspected of seeking to bring industry and government under workingmen&#x2019;s control by revolutionary means if necessary. It grew rapidly in ten years and became a much-feared force, especially in the Pacific North-west lumber country; but the union quickly lost support when it militantly opposed American participation in World War I. It was almost destroyed by a wide-scale persecution beginning in 1922, when it became a special target of President Harding&#x2019;s attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer, and his campaign against a &#x201c;red conspiracy.&#x201d; Though widely outlawed, the IWW was still in operation throughout the 1930s; and parents, especially in rural western communities like the one in which Steinbeck grew up at the height of its activities, still evoked threats of &#x201c;Wobblies&#x201d; as bogeymen to control unruly children.</p><p>Of more immediate and even more frightening concern was the strike that had closed down the port of San Francisco in 1934. Organized by Harry Bridges, an Australian labor leader, it began on May 9 as a walkout by rank-and-file members of the International Longshoremen&#x2019;s Association who were dissatisfied with their officers&#x2019; suspected collusion with employers. Other labor organizations joined in, threatening a general strike that might paralyze the city. On July 3 the police were ordered to try to infiltrate and secure the docks, in civic authorities&#x2019; anticipation that the national holiday the following day would create a lull that might lead to a gradual disintegration of the strike. On July 5&#x2014;Bloody Thursday&#x2014;however, the confrontation resumed with new vehemence. The police killed two protesters and wounded some seventy others at the scene.</p><p>The governor called out the National Guard the next day and appealed to the federal government to send in troops to protect property. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was on vacation at the time, bound for Hawaii on a U.S. Navy vessel; Secretary of State Cordell Hull had been left in charge in Washington. Hull panicked and decided to appeal to the president for an executive order to use federal troops. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, mindful of President Hoover&#x2019;s order to General Douglas MacArthur in 1932 to fire on the war veteran bonus marchers in Washington, objected that this would be the worst possible course to follow. Through Roosevelt&#x2019;s personal secretary, Perkins managed to get a message to the president, who agreed with her that the federal government should not become involved. After the events of Bloody Thursday, enthusiasm for th...</p></p><h2>The Aura of Torah: A Kabbalistic-Hasidic Commentary to the Weekly Readings</h2><p><p>Because a welter of details sometimes conceals the Torah&#x2019;s aura of holiness, Jewish mystics and spiritual teachers for centuries have attempted to reveal that aura through creative interpretation. <i>The Aura of&nbsp;Torah</i> explores these attempts in an effort to bridge the gap between the Torah text and the modern Jewish spiritual quest.</p><p>This book collects a wide variety of interpretations of Torah passages, commentaries, and midrash rooted in the mystical side of Jewish tradition,including&nbsp;original Hebrew and Aramaic texts translated by Rabbi Larry Tabick. The quoted authors span many centuries and speak from many schools of thought: kabbalists writing within the tradition of the Zohar and other gnostic works; Hasidic teachers from the modern movement founded by the Ba&#x2019;al Shem Tov in eighteenth-century Ukraine; and German pietists, or Hasidei Ashkenaz, of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Tabick examines how these texts build on the underlying principles of the Torah&#x2014;the supremacy of God, the interconnectedness of nature and morality, and the unique (though not exclusive) role of the Jewish people in the divine plan for all humanity&#x2014;to point to a deep spiritual truth in the world of the divine and the soul.<br></p></p><p><p>Larry Tabick is a rabbi of Shir Hayim, the Hampstead Reform Jewish Community in London.

The brothers' subsequent recording experiences in Memphis-which the author sees as being crucial to their overall development as musicians-are also described, as well as their early bands and, of course, their work together on Family Style.</p><p>The author of fifteen nonfiction books, more than 2,000 magazine and newspaper articles, and numerous poems and short stories, James L.

But now Ligotti has pulled together a collection of his favorite fiction, both old and new, representing his best and most characteristic works.<p>Thomas Ligotti's stories are perhaps best described as dark magical realism. Many of his stories center on the distorted perspective of a frequently doomed narrator. The title story, "The Shadow at the Bottom of the World," reimagines a kind of Bradbury-like small town that encounters the appearance of a kind of existential darkness, written with a sharp imagery like that of William S. Burroughs. In story after story in this collection, Ligotti does not merely present his readers with isolated incidents of supernatural horror - he challenges them to confront nightmares that are entwined in the very fabric of life itself. </p><p>QUOTES:</p><p>"The best new American writer of weird fiction to appear in years" - The Washington Post</p><p>"Ligotti is wonderfully original; he has a new vision of a dark and special kind, a vision that no one had before him." - Interzone</p><p>"Aficianados of the macabre consider Ligotti one of the finest writers in the field" - The Sunday Times</p><p>"Thomas Ligotti is an absolute master of supernatural horror and weird fiction, and a true original. He pursues his unique vision with admirable honesty and rigorousness and conveys it in prose as powerfully evocative as any writer in the field. I'd say he might just be a genius." - Ramsey Campbell ("Britain's most respected living horror writer," according to the Oxford Companion to English Literature)</p></p><p><p>Thomas Ligotti is regarded by many as one of the greatest living horror writers. His works have received numerous honors, including three Bram Stoker awards. In his book-length study of the modern weird tale, H. P. Lovecraft scholar and veteran critic of horror fiction S.T. Joshi has written of Ligotti's "The Last Feast of Harlequin" that "it may perhaps be the very best homage to Lovecraft ever written" and that, among his peers in the horror genre, Ligotti stands alone, remarking: "His is the most distinctive voice in the field." </p>&#34;Aficionados of the macabre consider Ligotti one of the finest writers in the field&#34; -The Sunday Times&#34;</p><h2>Composite Charts: The Astrology of Relationships</h2><p>Now you can use astrology to learn the secrets that will help you come to understand the intricacies of your relationships with other people, when you get <i>Composite Charts </i>by one of astrology's premier innovators, John Townley. <br> <br>Have you ever noticed that relationships seem to have a life of their own?

Coming to maturity during the reign of James I, Wallington witnessed the persecution of Puritans during Archbishop Laud&#x2019;s ascendancy under Charles I, welcomed what he thought would be the godly revolution brought by the Long Parliament, and watched with increasing disillusionment the falure of that dream under the Rump republic and the Cromwellian Protectorate.<br>The author reconstructs Wallington&#x2019;s inner world, allowing us to see what an ordinary man made of a lifetime of reading Puritan doctrine and listening to the sermons of Puritan preachers. For the first time we can penetrate the mind of one of those who made up the London mob calling for the end of episcopacy and the death of the Earl of Strafford in 1641, who welcomed the revolution, if not the war that followed, and who finally came to approve the death of his king.</p><p>Nehemiah Wallington (1598-1658) was a simple and firmly Puritan member of the Turners Guild in London. In extraordinary compliance with the Puritan dictum to lead a disciplined and examined life, he filled a number of notebooks with personal memoirs, political observations, and religious advice. Using this material and other relevant sources, Seaver has produced a richly documented reconstruction of Wallington's world view. The result is a look at the turbulent early Stuart era through the eyes of a common man. Since Wallington was an urban layperson, this book complements the rural and clerical viewpoint of Alan MacFarlane's The Family Life of Ralph Josselin: a seventeenth-century clergyman (1970).

Whether showing semi-nude women abalone divers struggling with their catch while a male crew of shriveled old salts leers from a nearby boat, or the carefree rapture of a leisurely group of men and women observing cherry blossoms at their peak, Hokusai captures, with drama and delicacy, sublime and ridiculous states. The artist&#39;s simplicity, though deceptive, is also remarkable: he illustrates a poem about a lovers&#39; seaside tryst with a magnificently imposing yet unadorned sailing vessel, its small window offering a coy glimpse of the fortunate couple inside. Each of the 111 color prints (as well as 41 black-and-white sketches of projected prints apparently never completed) is accompanied by the poem, in Japanese and English, a biographical note on the poet and by Peter Morse&#39;s comments on literary and artistic intention and execution.</p><p><b>Peter Morse</b> is Research Associate at the Honolulu Academy of Arts.

I enjoyed and admired it in equal measure&#39; Sarah Perry, author of The Essex Serpent &#39;An extraordinarily immersive read, that emphasises the power of stories, examining themes of motherhood, identity, exile and freedom ... a journey that not only crosses continents, but encompasses tragedy and rich sensuality&#39; Guardian &#39;A powerful tale of Barbary pirates ... richly imagined.&#39; Sunday Times &#39;Engrossing&#39; Sunday Express &#39;Fascinating ... a really, really good read&#39; BBC R2 Book Club &#39;The best sort of historical novel.&#39; Scotsman &#39;A lyrical tale&#39; Stylist &#39;A poetic retelling of Icelandic history.&#39; Daily Mail &#39;Compelling stuff&#39; Good Housekeeping In 1627 Barbary pirates raided the coast of Iceland and abducted some 400 of its people, including 250 from a tiny island off the mainland. Among the captives sold into slavery in Algiers were the island pastor, his wife and their three children. Although the raid itself is well documented, little is known about what happened to the women and children afterwards. It was a time when women everywhere were largely silent. In this brilliant reimagining, Sally Magnusson gives a voice to Asta, the pastor&#39;s wife. Enslaved in an alien Arab culture Asta meets the loss of both her freedom and her children with the one thing she has brought from home: the stories in her head. Steeped in the sagas and folk tales of her northern homeland, she finds herself experiencing not just the separations and agonies of captivity, but the reassessments that come in any age when intelligent eyes are opened to other lives, other cultures and other kinds of loving. The Sealwoman&#39;s Gift is about the eternal power of storytelling to help us survive. The novel is full of stories - Icelandic ones told to fend off a slave-owner&#39;s advances, Arabian ones to help an old man die. And there are others, too: the stories we tell ourselves to protect our minds from what cannot otherwise be borne, the stories we need to make us happy. &#39;Icelandic history has been brought to extraordinary life...

Kennedy Jr. (2nd Edition)</h2><p>Revised and Updated! <p>Contains 3 New Shocking Events Straight From Today's Headlines </p><p>Updated to include the shocking and terrifying events of the past two years, We Interrupt This Broadcast brings to life the famous and infamous moments of the twentieth century. This second edition covers in striking detail the impeachment proceedings of President Clinton, the Columbine High School tragedy and the death of JFK Jr.--along with 38 other history-making moments--with memorable audio, vivid photographs and compelling text. From the dawn of electronic media to today, these are the 41 events that stopped us in our tracks and changed our world. We Interrupt This Broadcast recounts the details of the events and spotlights the photographs that tell the stories.</p></p><p>Beginning with the explosion of the dirigible <i>Hindenburg</i> in 1937, this book and double-CD collection of audio broadcasts recalls a series of dramatic events so urgent that they interrupted scheduled broadcasting in America. The text of this package includes capsule explanations of such events as the attack on Pearl Harbor and the death of Elvis, accompanied by dramatic black-and-white stock photos. Introduced by the sonorous voice of TV journalist Bill Kurtis, the recordings of the news broadcasts revive the panic and thrill of some of the defining moments (mostly American) of the 20th century. This updated second edition includes three new events: the impeachment of President Clinton, the tragic shootings at Columbine High School, and the death of John F. Kennedy Jr. in an airplane crash. New recordings from the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, the <i>Apollo 13</i> mission, and the Munich Olympics tragedy have also been added. <p> <i>We Interrupt This Broadcast</i> offers, in some ways, a strange view of the past. News that interrupts broadcasts is always sensational and usually tragic. Of the 41 recordings, only five or so don't involve assassinations, explosions, death, or defeat. Furthermore, only the deaths of Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana represent the female side of modern events. Nevertheless, these recordings will fascinate many listeners too young to have heard the original broadcasts, and those who were alive at the time might enjoy hearing them again in all their crackling, nostalgic glory. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Author Joe Garner is a twenty-year veteran of the radio business, including eleven years as an executive with Westwood One, the international radio syndication company and owner of the NBC Radio Networks and Mutual Broadcasting System.

All with unique talents and personal reasons for joining Casey Woods's group, they'll do whatever it takes.<br><br>Able to accurately read people after the briefest of encounters, Casey picks up in the Willis household signs of a nervous spouse, a guilty conscience, a nanny that hides on her phone.

But time is running out, and Casey's team knows that the difference between getting Krissy back and her disappearing forever could be as small as a suspect's rapid breathing, or as deep as Hope's dark family history.<br><br></p><p>Andrea Kane&#x2019;s psychological thriller THE GIRL WHO DISAPPEARED TWICE became an instant New York Times bestseller, the latest in a long string of smash hits. THE LINE BETWEEN HERE AND GONE is the next exhilarating installment in the Forensic Instincts series. With a worldwide following and novels published in over twenty languages, Kane is also the author of eight romantic thrillers and fourteen historical romances. She lives in New Jersey with her family.<br><br>The bar smelled like stale beer and sweat.<br><br>Casey Woods shifted in her seat, which was situated far away from the social hub of the place. She rolled her glass between her palms. It was filled with whatever was on tap that the waiter had brought her. Taking a sip, she looked nervous but wistful among the slew of college kids milling around the East Village hangout.<br><br>She was one of those kids. Or trying to be. She was a wannabe&#x2014;a shy and naive misfit, on the outside, looking in. Hungry to be welcomed into the inner circle.<br><br>She reached around and fiddled with a strand of her long red hair, which was tied back, giving her a more youthful appearance. Her gaze darted around, flickering, every so often, over her target. He was in his early thirties, perched on the first bar stool. Whenever she glanced his way, he was usually staring at her.<br><br>The time ticked by slowly. Casey made sure to openly, if shyly, eye the hunkiest-looking guys, changing her demeanor from hopeful to unsure or dejected. Every guy she focused on eventually left, either with a group of friends, or with a girl he'd hooked up with.<br><br>At just past three-thirty in the morning, the bartender started closing up, and the bar emptied out. With just a few stragglers left, Casey's hopes for the night were ostensibly dashed. Her lashes lowered in an expression of utter defeat.<br><br>Slowly, she rose, reaching into her messenger bag for some cash. As she'd planned, the bag slid off her shoulder and plopped on the floor, contents spilling everywhere. Flushed with embarrassment, she squatted down and began stuffing things back into her bag&#x2014;her wallet, makeup, and fake student ID.<br><br>From her peripheral vision, she saw the man at the end of the bar rise, toss some bills on the counter and walk out with the last few stragglers.<br><br>It was 4:00 a.m. Closing time.<br><br>Despite the pointed glare of the bartender, Casey took her time replacing the contents of her bag, rearranging them as she did. She kept her wallet out long enough to slap some bills on the table. Then she made her way to the door.<br><br>The bartender locked it behind her.<br><br>Casey sucked in her breath and turned, making sure to follow the same route she'd been taking all week. She'd set the pattern. But tonight she'd stayed at the bar later. The streets were emptier. The timing was right.<br><br>She steeled herself as she walked past the alley near Tompkins Square Park. She kept her gaze fixed straight ahead.<br><br>She heard Fisher's footsteps an instant before he grabbed her. His arm clamped around her waist, his free hand pressing a knife to her throat. Too hard. Too fast. No taunting. This was <em>not</em> how she'd planned it. And now he had her.<br><br>"Don't fight. Don't scream. Don't even breathe. Or I'll slit your throat."<br><br>Casey complied. She didn't have to fake her trembling, or the fear that stiffened her body. Silently, she talked herself down, reminding herself why she was doing this. She offered no resistance as Fisher dragged her into the alley. The psychopathic SOB shoved her down on the filthy concrete ground, kneeling over her, a glittering look of triumph in his eyes. He kept the knife at her throat, using his other hand to tear at her jeans.<br><br>The button popped. But the zipper never gave.<br><br>Marc Deveraux made sure of that.<br><br>Emerging from the shadows like a predator in the wild, he lunged at the would-be rapist with all the strength of his powerful build. He yanked Fisher's knife-wielding arm up and away from Casey, then slammed down on his forearm until Fisher's bones made a cracking sound and the knife clattered to the ground.<br><br>Fisher howled with pain.<br><br>"I'm just getting started," Marc promised menacingly. He dragged Fisher up and slammed his back against the wall. "You okay?" he called out to Casey, who was scrambling to her feet.<br><br>"A hell of a lot better than I was thirty seconds ago," she managed.<br><br>"Good." He turned his attention back to Fisher. "Talk," he ordered, one knee pushed into Fisher's groin and one elbow digging into his windpipe.<br><br>"The girl came on to me," Fisher said, then yelped, sweat beading on his forehead. "She&#x2014;" His breath caught as Marc increased the pressure of his knee.<br><br>"Wrong answer. Tell me about your plans for this girl&#x2014;and what you did with all the others." He leaned closer, until his face nearly touched the other man's. "You don't want to know what I am or what I'm capable of. Compared to me, you're a Girl Scout." His elbow shoved deeper, cutting off most of Fisher's oxygen. "Now tell me about the girls&#x2014;all of them. And don't spare any details. I'm a captive audience."<br><br>It took longer than expected to get Fisher's confession. It took a Navy SEAL's thumb dug deeply into his collarbone, causing blinding pain that persisted long after the pressure was removed, and the threat that a repeat performance would increase the pain tenfold if that's what it took to make the perp talk&#x2014;assuming his neck didn't snap first. The bastard's cold-blooded confession had made bile rise in Casey's throat. He might be going to jail for a long, long time, but Casey wished they were throwing away the key for good.<br><br>"I'm done here, Marc," she told her rescuer. "Otherwise I'm going to be sick."<br><br>"Go," he urged quietly. "I'll wrap things up here and head over to the precinct. The bodies will be found. Any claim of coercion will be tossed. It's a murderer's word against ours. The confession will stick. Go home."<br><br>Home was a four-story Tribeca brownstone that was residence and office combined. There was no beating that. One mortgage. One place that held all her worldly possessions. And no commute. It was ideal.<br><br>Of course, she rarely made it up to the fourth floor, which was supposedly where she slept. Her bed was a casual acquaintance, if not a stranger. She virtually lived in her office. That was her choice. One she made every day. And she wasn't sorry.<br><br>With a quick glance around the reception level, she turned left and climbed the L-shaped staircase to the second floor. Directly ahead, she'd had French doors installed&#x2014;doors that led out to a balcony overlooking the manicured garden in a gated backyard. Colorful flower beds. A maze of closely trimmed shrubs. And a pair of graceful willow trees on either side, rippling in the breeze. The entire effect was both serene and eye-catching.<br><br>Pushing open the doors, Casey stepped outside for a moment, quickly shutting them behind her. She hoped the cool air would revive her. Sighing, she noted that the sun was now well above the horizon, and climbing rapidly into the sky. Her watch told her it was nine-thirty. The unofficial coercion Marc had inflicted had taken a lot longer than expected to work. To Casey, it had seemed like an eternity before they'd pulled it off and extracted a full confession from Fisher.<br><br>She could still feel the perv's slimy hands on her. He'd really freaked her out.<br><br>With a shudder, Casey reminded herself that they <em>had</em> pulled it off, and gotten both&#x2014;Fisher <em>and</em> his confession regarding the other victims. Not a pretty business. Still, the haunting, disturbing feelings inflicted by such men were the very reason she'd formed Forensic Instincts, LLC to begin with.<br><br>She walked across the balcony and reached the second set of French doors that led back into the brownstone. She held her access card up to the card reader and punched her security code into the Hirsch keypad. Pushing the doors open, she stepped inside and shut the doors behind her. No time for rest&#x2014;not yet. It was time for her team's post-op meeting.<br><br>Forensic Instincts had been just a dream at first. Now it was very much a reality.<br><br>It all started four years ago, and was still in its fledgling state. Casey had begun her quest to assemble an awesome team, with herself at the helm. Thanks to her extensive credentials working with both behavioral and psychological profilers, her innate talent at reading people, and her years of working in both law enforcement and the private sector, Casey had easily transitioned into an independent profiler. She held a master's in Forensic Psychology from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and a bachelor's in Psychology from Columbia. Most importantly, she was a natural at figuring out what made people tick.<br><br>Her two other team members were impressive as hell. She should know. She'd meticulously selected them. Assessed them. Recruited them. They were very different from each other. Both brought specialized capabilities to the Forensic Instincts team. The result was a growing track record of successfully solved complex criminal cases.<br><br>Their trio was unique, but still formative. Which meant they were sometimes welcomed, and other times regarded as a huge pain in the ass.<br><br>But, overall, they were earning a growing respect among law enforcement agencies and, more important, among their expanding client list. To those who hired them, they were the ultimate beacon of hope.<br><br>Her rules were few, but absolute. Unwavering loyalty, both to the company and to one another. One hundred and ten percent of themselves when they were on the job. Total candor, regardless of the cost&#x2014;but only when they were behind closed doors. A low profile&#x2014;which meant staunchly avoiding the limelight. As mavericks who pushed the boundaries more than conventional bureaucracy would allow, it was best to be unrecognizable. They were an eclectic trio, each of whom believed absolutely in his or her specific methods.<br><br>Three egos were involved. And none of them shy. That meant frequent debates, tons of constructive argument and&#x2014;sometimes&#x2014;stubborn unwillingness to budge. With the Fisher case, Casey had wanted to nail their perp by studying his interactions with college-aged women, then combining behavioral observations with her experience and sheer instinct. Marc had argued in favor of using statistics and past research to form a solid scientific base from which he'd work up a profile before going in for the kill. And Ryan was adamant about implementing game theory&#x2014;getting inside Fisher's head, figuring out his sick reasoning&#x2014;where he chose to hunt, and the strategies he used to go after his prey. The twenty-eight-year-old guy was an awesome combination of technology genius and strategic thinker. He studied behavioral patterns through complex computer programming and crunching enormous amounts of raw data, and then applied it to his analysis of human dynamics.<br><br>Each team member believed fervently in his or her methods. Fortunately, the whole was greater than the sum of its parts.<br><br>Yes, they made quite a team&#x2014;strong willed, but the best. Casey expected nothing less as she expanded the operations, and Forensic Instincts grew. Her grandfather would have been proud. She'd used her trust fund wisely and well.<br><br>Smiling faintly, she looked around. The second set of French doors had granted her entry to the second-floor conference room. It was the largest and most elaborate space in the brownstone.<br><br>As she walked in, an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling video screens began to glow. A long, green line formed across each panel, pulsating from left to right. Then, a soothing voice, that seemed to emanate from every cubic inch of the room, said, "Welcome back, Casey," bending each line into the contour of the voice pattern. It continued, "Warning. Heart rate elevated."<br><br>Casey started. She just couldn't get used to being greeted by Yoda, the latest incarnation of Ryan McKay&#x2014; Forensic Instincts' brilliant techno-wizard&#x2014;and his artificial intelligence system. Somehow the damned thing knew who was in the room. It even knew when something was out of the ordinary. Like now. No matter how many times Ryan tried to explain to her how Yoda worked, to Casey it still sounded like magic.<br><br>The conference room was pure class. Polished hardwood floors. A plush Oriental rug. An expansive mahogany conference table and matching credenza. And, most crucial of all, a technology infrastructure that was light-years ahead of its time in both design and operation, all hidden from view. Only the gigantic video wall was visible, covering the longest side of the room and allowing Ryan to assemble a dizzying array of information into a large single image or several smaller, simultaneous data feeds. Videoconferencing equipment, an elaborate phone system, and a personalized virtual workstation available to each member of the group completed the elaborate system.<br><br>And it was all controlled by Yoda, who unwaveringly responded to requests made by team members. Behind the "shock and awe" of Yoda was a server farm located in the office's secure data center downstairs. Like a proud papa, Ryan had named their custom-built servers: Lumen, Equitas and Intueri, from the Latin words for light, justice and intuition. The names had become so much a part of Forensic Instincts that they'd incorporated them into the company logo.<br><br>Casey still found herself awed by the sophistication, power and pervasiveness of the technology. Truthfully, she didn't understand the half of how it worked. But Ryan did. And that was all that mattered.<br><br>Heading across the hardwood floor, Casey paused at the edge of the rug, then pulled back a chair and sat down at the long, oval conference table.<br><br>Leaning back, she called out, "Yoda, please show me TV news."<br><br>"Would you like world news, national news or local news?" Yoda inquired pleasantly.<br><br>"Local."<br><br>"CBS, NBC, Fox, ABC or all?" Yoda asked.<br><br>"All."<br><br>Yoda carried out her command by simultaneously showing all four channels, each occupying one-fourth of the wall.<br><br>Casey pivoted her chair around so she had a direct view. Staring intently, she tugged off the hair band she'd worn tonight, shook out her long red mane and combed her fingers through the tangled strands. When Glen Fisher appeared on the Fox News screen, she instructed, "Yoda, Fox News full screen."<br><br>Instantly, Glen Fisher filled the entire wall. He was sweating and agitated, and quickly bent forward to hide his face as the cameras zoomed in on him being hauled out of the alley and into the squad car.<br><br></p><h2>Pilgermann</h2><p>A traveler on the road to Jerusalem during the First Crusade of 1096, moving across a landscape of grotesque horror and extravagant beauty, meets God and Satan in all their forms</p><p>Russell Hoban is the author of many extraordinary novels including The Lion of Boaz-Jachin and Jachin-Boaz, Turtle Diary, Kleinzeit and Angelica&#39;s Grotto, also available from Bloomsbury.

The quiet country road running between the trees was full of shadows; in an hour or so it would be dusk. The girl sitting on the grass verge shivered a little and put her arm around the lean, unkempt animal beside her: a half-grown dog in a deplorable condition, the rope which had held him fast to a tree still dangling from his scraggy neck. It was when she had found him not an hour earlier and struggled to free him that he had knocked her down. She had fallen awkwardly and twisted her ankle, and getting herself as far as the road had been a nightmare that she was relieved to have done with. Now she sat, more or less patiently, hoping for help. Two cars had gone past since she had dragged herself and the dog to the road but although she had waved and shouted neither of them had stopped. She studied her ankle in the dimming light; it had swollen alarmingly and she hadn't been able to get her shoe off; there was nothing to do but wait for help, although, since the road was not much more than a country lane connecting two villages, there didn't seem much chance of that before early morning when the farm tractors would begin their work.<br><br>'We may have to spend the night,' she told the animal beside her, for the sound of her voice was a comfort of sorts, 'but I'll look after you, although I'm not sure how.' The animal cowered closer; she could feel its ribs against her side, and she gave it a soothing pat. 'It's nice to have company, anyway,' she assured him.<br><br>Dusk had fallen when she heard a car coming and presently its headlights swept over them as it passed.<br><br>'That's that,' said the girl. 'You can't blame anyone for not stopping...'<br><br>However, the car was coming back, reversing slowly until it was level with them and then stopping. The man who got out appeared to her nervous eyes to be a giant and she felt a distinct desire to get up and run, only she couldn't. He came towards her slowly and somehow when he spoke his voice was reassuringly quiet and calm.<br><br>'Can I help?' he asked, and his voice was kind too. 'You're hurt?'<br><br>He stood for a moment looking down at her; a small girl with no looks, too thin, but even in the deepening dusk her eyes were beautiful.<br><br>'Well, not really hurt, but I twisted my ankle and I can't walk.' She studied him carefully and liked what she saw. This was no young man out for an evening's ride but a soberly clad man past his first youth, his pale hair silvered at the temples. He was good-looking too, though that did not matter. 'I would be very grateful for a lift as far as Minton Cracknell; it's only a couple of miles along the road. I live there.'<br><br>'Of course, but may I look at your ankle first? I'm a doctor and it looks as though it needs attention.'<br><br>He squatted down beside her, and, when the dog growled, put out a large hand for the beast to sniff. 'We must have that shoe off,' he told her, and got out a pocket knife and cut the laces.<br><br>'I'm going to hurt you,' he said, and did despite his gentleness. 'Good girl. Catch your breath while I get some bandage from the car.'<br><br>He was gone and back again before she had had the time to wipe away the tears on her cheeks; she hadn't said a word while the shoe was coming off but she hadn't been able to stop the tears. He handed her a handkerchief without a word and said cheerfully, 'It will feel much better once I've strapped it up. You will have to get it X-rayed tomorrow and rest it for a day or two.'<br><br>He got to his feet. 'The dog is yours?' he asked.<br><br>'Well, no&#x2014;I&#x2014;I heard him barking as I came along the road and he'd been tied to a tree and left to starve; he accidentally tripped me up as I was freeing him.'<br><br>'Poor beast, but lucky for him that you heard him. Will you adopt him?'<br><br>He was talking idly, giving her time to pull herself together.<br><br>'Well, I don't think I can&#x2014;my stepmother doesn't like dogs&#x2014;but I can give him a bed and a meal and see if there's anyone in the village.'<br><br>'Well, let's get you home,' he said kindly, and scooped her up with a word to the dog, who needed no encouragement but climbed into the back of the car after the girl had been settled in the front seat.<br><br>'He'll make an awful mess,' she said apologetically, 'and it's a Bentley, isn't it?'<br><br>The man looked amused. 'I don't suppose there will be any lasting damage,' he observed. 'Where do you live exactly?'<br><br>'If you go through the village it's the house on the right behind a high brick wall. It's called the Old Rectory. My father inherited it from his father; it's been in the family for years.'<br><br>She glanced at his profile. 'You've been very kind.'<br><br>'I'm glad that I happened to pass by, Miss.?' 'Preece, Cressida Preece.' She added shyly, 'You're not english, are you?'<br><br>'Dutch. Van der Linus&#x2014;Aldrik van der Linus.'<br><br>She said politely, 'Your English is quite perfect. Oh, here's the village.'<br><br>The narrow main street of the little place was empty; it was the hour of high tea and lights shone from windows as they passed the small houses lining it.<br><br>'It's just along here, past the church...'<br><br>The houses had petered out and the car's lights touched on the brick wall and an open gate. The drive was short, ending in a small sweep before a nice old house, not over large but solidly built. The man got out but before he reached the door it was opened by a severe-looking woman with iron-grey hair drawn back into a bun. She had a long thin face and sharp, very dark eyes, and she was dressed in a shabby dress under a white apron.<br><br>She looked at the man with a belligerence which he ignored.<br><br>'I have brought Miss Preece home,' he told her. 'She has damaged her ankle. If you will tell me where her room is, I will carry her indoors. I think there is no lasting damage but she should rest it for a few days.'<br><br>The woman didn't answer him but brushed past him and out to the car.<br><br>'Miss Cressida, what has happened? Are you hurt? You must get to your bed.'<br><br>The girl spoke matter-of-factly, 'Moggy, dear, I'm quite all right, just sprained an ankle. Mother's not back?' There was a hint of anxiety in her voice, and the man, who had come to stand by the car, frowned.<br><br>'No, thank the lord. We'll get you indoors.' Moggy heard a faint growl from the back seat and exclaimed 'What's that&#x2014;an animal.?'<br><br>'A dog, Moggy. I found him tied to a tree. We'll have to hide him tonight and tomorrow I'll go to the village and try and find a home for him.' Cressida undid her seat belt. 'He must have a meal, he's starved.'<br><br>'She'll not allow it. We'll get you to your room and I'll feed him and take him down to old Mr Fellows and ask if he will keep the beast in his shed...'<br><br>'It might be advisable to get Miss Preece up to her bed,' said the man gently, 'and since I gather the dog is not welcome here I'll take him with me. I'm going in to Yeovil; there's a good vet there.'<br><br>'A vet?' said Cressida sharply. 'He's not to be put to sleep.'<br><br>'Certainly not. And now, if I may, I'll carry you indoors and perhaps when we have you settled this animal might be given a small meal.' And at her look of doubt, 'I give you my word that he'll be properly looked after.' He had spoken quietly but Moggy stood back without a word and allowed him to lift Cressida from the car and carry her into the house.<br><br>'Up the stairs,' she told him gruffly, 'and down that passage beyond the landing.'<br><br>He went up the wide oak staircase unhurriedly, carrying Cressida with no effort, and waited while Moggy went ahead of them and opened a door at the end of the passage.<br><br>The room was small and plainly furnished and Dr van der Linus frowned again, for it seemed to him that it was a room suitable to a servant, not the daughter of the house. He laid her gently on the bed and stooped to take a look at the ankle.<br><br>'I suggest that you take a couple of paracetamol before you settle for the night,' he observed, 'and be sure and get your doctor to come and look at it in the morning. He may wish to re-strap it and give you instructions as to treatment. You will need to keep off your feet for a few days but he will do what is necessary.' He stood looking down at her. 'Have you paracetamol? Take two as soon as possible with a drink.'<br><br>He took her hand in his large one. 'A most unfortunate accident, but you will be quite all right again very shortly. And don't worry about the dog, I'll see that it comes to no harm. Goodbye, Miss Preece.'<br><br>She didn't want him to go; a sensible girl, inured to accepting what life had to offer her, she wished very much that he would stay. But that, of course, was impossible; he was a complete stranger who had happened to turn up just when he was most needed. Then she thanked him in a polite voice tight with pain and watched his vast back go through the door with regret. At least the dog would be safe and her stepmother had been away from home. She comforted herself with that.<br><br>Dr van der Linus trod slowly down the staircase with Moggy leading the way. In the hall he stood still. 'You will look after Miss Preece? She is in a good deal of pain, but get her into bed with a warm drink and the paracetamol and she should sleep. Her own doctor will prescribe what he thinks fit.' He smiled down at the severe face. 'Could I bother you for some water for the dog, and perhaps a slice of bread?' And at her nod, 'May I know your name?'<br><br>'Mogford&#x2014;Miss, but Miss Cressy always calls me Moggy, since she was knee-high.' She went ahead of him. 'I've some soup on the stove; perhaps a drop of that would do the beast some good, then I'll go and see to Miss Cressy.'<br><br>She led the way into the kitchen and poured soup into a bowl and broke some bread into it. 'You won't be long?' she asked anxiously. 'Mrs Preece doesn't hold with animals. It's a mercy that she's out. .there'll be a fuss enough over Miss Cressy.'<br><br>'Yes. I'm sure your mistress will be upset,' observed Dr van der Linus smoothly.<br><br>'Upset? Oh, she'll be upset, all right.' She glanced at the clock. 'She'll be back in twenty minutes or so, you'd best hurry.'<br><br>Dr van der Linus's eyebrows rose but all he said was, 'I'll be very quick. Shall I leave the bowl behind a bush for you to collect later?'<br><br>His companion nodded. 'Thank you for your trouble. You've been most kind.'<br><br>She shut the front door upon him and he went to the car, let the dog out while it ate and drank hungrily and then ushered it back in. He had driven a couple of miles and was almost at Templecombe when a car flashed past him. There was a woman driving. Probably Mrs Preece, he reflected as he turned off the road to take the short cut to Yeovil and the vet.<br><br>That gentleman, roused from his comfortable chair by the fire, peered at the dog standing dejectedly on the end of its rope. 'My dear Aldrik, what on earth have you here?'<br><br>'A dog, John. I have acquired him from his rescuer who is unable to offer food and shelter. Found tied to a tree on the other side of Minton Cracknell.'<br><br>'Want me to have a look? He's in pretty poor shape.' He patted the dog's matted head. 'I didn't know you were over here. Staying with Lady Merrill? You must come and dine one evening before you go back.'<br><br>He led the way through the house and out again into a yard at the back to his surgery. 'How is the old lady?'<br><br>'In splendid form. Her years sit lightly on her.' He heaved the reluctant dog on to the examination table, gentling him with a steady hand.<br><br>'Over here on holiday or doing some work?'<br><br>'Oh, a little of both. I've had a week in Edinburgh; I'm going on to Bristol to give a series of lectures and then back to London before I go home.'<br><br>'Well, dine with us before you leave. Molly will be disappointed if you don't. How about one evening next week? Any evening, take pot luck.'<br><br>'I should like that. May I give you a ring?'<br><br>The vet was bending over the dog. 'He hasn't anything broken as far as I can see. Half starved&#x2014;more than half&#x2014;and ill-treated&#x2014;look at these sores. Do you want me to get him fit, or.?'<br><br>'Get him fit, will you? I promised his rescuer; a dab of a girl with huge brown eyes.'<br><br>John looked up. 'You say he was found near Minton Cracknell? That would be Cressida Preece. She brought me a cat a month or two ago&#x2014;in a bad way, paid to have her cured of burns, quite nasty ones as a result of some lout tying a squib to her tail. She's still paying me, a bit at a time.'<br><br>'And yet she lives in a pleasant house.?'<br><br>'Yes but I fancy her life isn't as pleasant. Her father died some months ago; she lives with her stepmother. Unfortunately he left everything to her under the impression, one presumes, that she would provide for his daughter.'<br><br>Dr van der Linus stroked the trembling dog's head. 'Surely in this day and age the girl can leave home and get a job?'<br><br>'One would think so, though I don't imagine she's trained for anything. What shall I do? Get this beast fit and let her know?'<br><br>'No. I've taken rather a fancy to him. I'll take him with me when I go back to Holland. May I leave him with you? My grandmother will be wondering where I have got to.'<br><br>'Give me a ring in the morning, and we'll see how he is after some food and a night's sleep.'</p><h2>The Asimov Chronicles: Fifty Years of Isaac Asimov, Vol. 1</h2><p>Gathers stories from each period in the author&#39;s career concerning robots, time travel, and space exploration</p><p>Isaac Asimov authored over 400 books in a career that lasted nearly 50 years.

At the same time, he spent most of his career surrounded by controversy and ridicule--over his affairs with white film stars, his 1960 marriage to Swedish actress May Britt, his conversion to Judaism, his closeness to the Kennedys (and later Richard Nixon), and his problems with alcohol and drugs.<br><br>When Davis published his first memoir, <i>Yes, I Can</i>, in 1965, it was a critical and popular success--acclaimed for a candor and thoughtfulness rare in celebrity autobiographies and for its painful evocation of life as a black peformer in segregated America. Davis's 1980 memoir, <i>Why Me?</i>, laid bare Davis's troubled relationship to the Kennedys, his ambivalence toward the Black Pride movement, the end of his marriage to Britt (and his complex open marriage with Altovise Davis), and his flamboyant, self-loathing misbehavior, from ruinous extravagance to flirtations with Satanism.<br><br>Davis's co-writer Burt Boyar has revised Davis's memoirs, incorporating material from unpublished interviews, and has added a new introduction and epilogue. The result is a testament to an unacknowledged--often uncomfortable--leader in the struggle for racial equality. <br></p><p></p><h2>More! Hand Applique by Machine: 9 Quilt Projects, Updated Techniques, Needle-Turn Results Without Handwork</h2><p>If you hate hand sewing, or can&#39;t sew by hand, or you simply like to do everything the fastest, easiest way, this clever new applique method is just what you&#39;ve been waiting for. Beth Ferrier&#39;s breezy style makes learning fun.</p><p>When I was first learning to quilt, I despaired that beautiful appliqu� was only the work of needle-turn goddesses. Being the stubborn sort (though I prefer to think of myself as tenacious), I set out to conquer appliqu�. Because I&#39;m almost pathologically curious and willing to experiment, I spent the next few years trying all sorts of appliqu� techniques. Often I found myself wondering why it seemed that we quilters were so often doing things the hard way. Bit by bit I kept the parts of a technique that I liked and searched for better options to replace those I didn&#39;t. It took the chiding of my students to finally understand that I had, indeed, come up with a new approach to appliqu�, one that I needed to write down. The result was my first book, Hand Appliqu� by Machine. In the years since that first book was published, the quilting industry has blessed us with fantastic new products, making traditional techniques easier to achieve and allowing us to take our appliqu� in nifty new directions. My goal has always been to find a way to make appliqu� fun and easy without sacrificing that turned edge. But most of all, I wanted to make appliqu� free-spirited again--open to interpretation instead of persnickety perfection.

The greatest test pilot of them all, he was a World War II flying ace and the first man to fly faster than the speed of sound.People who know nothing else about aviation know that it was Chuck Yeager who broke the sound barrier. Those who have read Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff also know he did it with broken ribs from a nocturnal horse race. Readers of this engrossing work will find these circumstances typical of the way Yeager has always done things. In matter-of-fact language that covers both suspenseful flying descriptions and high times with drunken flying buddies, Yeager holds one's attention with the same ease that he brought to research and test flying. There is understatement in his descriptions of combat flying over Europe, of family life and his displeasure over having to be gone so long, of the years in the California desert; and his confident tone enhances these and other reminiscences in what has to be the aviation literature event of the year, and a bonus for general readers, too.

1<br>Sanjaya<br>Your son Duryodhana, the king,<br><br>seeing the Pandava forces arrayed,<br><br>approached his teacher Drona<br><br>and spoke in command. 2<br>"My teacher, see<br><br>the great Pandava army arrayed<br><br>by Drupada's son,<br><br>your pupil, intent on revenge. 3<br>Here are heroes, mighty archers<br><br>equal to Bhima and Arjuna in warfare,<br><br>Yuyudhana, Virata, and Drupada,<br><br>your sworn foe on his great chariot. 4<br>Here too are Dhrishtaketu, Cekitana,<br><br>and the brave king of Benares;<br><br>Purujit, Kuntibhoja,<br><br>and the manly king of the Shibis. 5<br><br>Yudhamanyu is bold,<br><br>and Uttamaujas is brave;<br><br>the sons of Subhadra and Draupadi<br><br>all command great chariots. 6<br>Now, honored priest, mark<br><br>the superb men on our side<br><br>as I tell you the names<br><br>of my army's leaders. 7<br>They are you and Bhishma,<br><br>Karna and Kripa, a victor in battles,<br><br>your own son Ashvatthama,<br><br>Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 8<br>Many other heroes also risk<br><br>their lives for my sake,<br><br>bearing varied weapons<br><br>and skilled in the ways of war. 9<br>Guarded by Bhishma, the strength<br><br>of our army is without limit;<br><br>but the strength of their army,<br><br>guarded by Bhima, is limited. 10<br>In all the movements of battle,<br><br>you and your men,<br><br>stationed according to plan,<br><br>must guard Bhishma well!" 11<br>Bhishma, fiery elder of the Kurus,<br><br>roared his lion's roar<br><br>and blew his conch horn,<br><br>exciting Duryodhana's delight. 12<br><br>Conches and kettledrums,<br><br>cymbals, tabors, and trumpets<br><br>were sounded at once<br><br>and the din of tumult arose. 13<br>Standing on their great chariot<br><br>yoked with white stallions,<br><br>Krishna and Arjuna, Pandu's son,<br><br>sounded their divine conches. 14<br>Krishna blew Pancajanya, won from a demon;<br><br>Arjuna blew Devadatta, a gift of the gods;<br><br>fierce wolf-bellied Bhima blew Paundra,<br><br>his great conch of the east. 15<br>Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, the king,<br><br>blew Anantavijaya, conch of boundless victory;<br><br>his twin brothers Nakula and Sahadeva<br><br>blew conches resonant and jewel toned. 16<br>The king of Benares, a superb archer,<br><br>and Shikhandin on his great chariot,<br><br>Drishtadyumna, Virata, and indomitable Satyaki,<br><br>all blew their conches. 17<br>Drupada, with his five grandsons,<br><br>and Subhadra's strong-armed son,<br><br>each in his turn blew<br><br>their conches, O King. 18<br>The noise tore the hearts<br><br>of Dhritarashtra's sons,<br><br>and tumult echoed<br><br>through heaven and earth. 19<br><br>Arjuna, his war flag a rampant monkey,<br><br>saw Dhritarashtra's sons assembled<br><br>as weapons were ready to clash,<br><br>and he lifted his bow. 20<br>He told his charioteer:<br><br>"Krishna,<br><br>halt my chariot<br><br>between the armies! 21<br>Far enough for me to see<br><br>these men who lust for war,<br><br>ready to fight with me<br><br>in the strain of battle. 22<br>I see men gathered here,<br><br>eager to fight,<br><br>bent on serving the folly<br><br>of Dhritarashtra's son." 23<br>When Arjuna had spoken,<br><br>Krishna halted<br><br>their splendid chariot<br><br>between the armies. 24<br>Facing Bhishma and Drona<br><br>and all the great kings,<br><br>he said, "Arjuna, see<br><br>the Kuru men assembled here!" 25<br>Arjuna saw them standing there:<br><br>fathers, grandfathers, teachers,<br><br>uncles, brothers, sons,<br><br>grandsons, and friends. 26<br><br>He surveyed his elders<br><br>and companions in both armies,<br><br>all his kinsmen<br><br>assembled together. 27<br>Dejected, filled with strange pity,<br><br>he said this:<br><br>"Krishna, I see my kinsmen<br><br>gathered here, wanting war. 28<br>My limbs sink,<br><br>my mouth is parched,<br><br>my body trembles,<br><br>the hair bristles on my flesh. 29<br>The magic bow slips<br><br>from my hand, my skin burns,<br><br>I cannot stand still,<br><br>my mind reels. 30<br>I see omens of chaos,<br><br>Krishna; I see no good<br><br>in killing my kinsmen<br><br>in battle. 31<br>Krishna, I seek no victory,<br><br>or kingship or pleasures.<br><br>What use to us are kingship,<br><br>delights, or life itself?

37<br>The greed that distorts their reason<br><br>blinds them to the sin they commit<br><br>in ruining the family, blinds them<br><br>to the crime of betraying friends. 38<br>How can we ignore the wisdom<br><br>of turning from this evil<br><br>when we see the sin<br><br>of family destruction, Krishna? 39<br>When the family is ruined,<br><br>the timeless laws of family duty<br><br>perish; and when duty is lost,<br><br>chaos overwhelms the family. 40<br><br>In overwhelming chaos, Krishna,<br><br>women of the family are corrupted;<br><br>and when women are corrupted,<br><br>disorder is born in society. 41<br>This discord drags the violators<br><br>and the family itself to hell;<br><br>for ancestors fall when rites<br><br>of offering rice and water lapse. 42<br>The sins of men who violate<br><br>the family create disorder in society<br><br>that undermines the constant laws<br><br>of caste and family duty. 43<br>Krishna, we have heard<br><br>that a place in hell<br><br>is reserved for men<br><br>who undermine family duties. 44<br>I lament the great sin<br><br>we commit when our greed<br><br>for kingship and pleasures<br><br>drives us to kill our kinsmen. 45<br>If Dhritarashtra's armed sons<br><br>kill me in battle when I am unarmed<br><br>and offer no resistance,<br><br>it will be my reward." 46<br>Saying this in the time of war,<br><br>Arjuna slumped into the chariot<br><br>and laid down his bow and arrows,<br><br>his mind tormented by grief. 47<br>THE SECOND TEACHING<br>PHILOSOPHY AND<br><br>SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE<br>Sanjaya<br>Arjuna sat dejected,<br><br>filled with pity,<br><br>his sad eyes blurred by tears.<br><br>Krishna gave him counsel. 1<br>Lord Krishna<br>Why this cowardice<br><br>in time of crisis, Arjuna?<br><br>The coward is ignoble, shameful,<br><br>foreign to the ways of heaven. 2<br>Don't yield to impotence!<br><br>It is unnatural in you!<br><br>Banish this petty weakness from your heart.<br><br>Rise to the fight, Arjuna! 3<br>Arjuna<br>Krishna, how can I fight<br><br>against Bhishma and Drona<br><br>with arrows<br><br>when they deserve my worship?

The girl sleuths "thrilled us and contented us at the same time," the author writes. Holding up Nancy Drew as a model of "the conventional and the revolutionary in one compact package," Mason shows how the series heroines encouraged young readers to "dream big" and stay open to life's possibilities, dished up antidotes to spoon-fed notions of traditional femininity, and amiably subverted the literary snobbery of child experts, librarians, and book reviewers.</p><p>Everyone who grew up reading mystery books will enjoy Bobbie Ann Mason's witty, sometimes nostalgic, observations on popular culture, childhood, and the pleasures of reading and writing.</p></p><p>In this long out-of-print work, Bobbie Ann Mason reminisces about her childhood reading of the girl detective series books.

In one way or another, every character in <i>Home</i> is searching for that answer. Glory Boughton, now 38 and lovelorn, has returned to Gilead to care for her dying father. Her wayward brother Jack also finds his way back, though his is an uneasy homecoming, reverberating with the scandal that drove him away twenty years earlier. Glory and Jack unravel their stories slowly, speaking to each other more in movements than in words--a careful glance here, a chair pulled out from the table there--against a domestic backdrop so richly imagined you may be fooled into believing their house is your own. Meanwhile, their father, whose ebullient love for his children is a welcome counterpoint to Glory and Jack's conflicted emotions, experiences his own kind of reckoning as he yearns to understand his troubled son. There is a simplicity to this story that belies the complexity of its characters--they are bound together by a profound capacity for love and by an equally powerful sense of private conviction that tries the ties that bind, but never breaks them. It's a delicate sort of tension that you think would resist exposition--and in fact these characters seem to want nothing more than, as Glory says, to treat "one another's deceptions like truth"--but Marilynne Robinson's fine, tender prose imbues this family's secrets with an overwhelming grace. --<i>Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br><p><strong>MARILYNNE ROBINSON</strong> is the recipient of a 2012 National Humanities Medal, awarded by President Barack Obama, for &#x201c;her grace and intelligence in writing.&#x201d; In 2013 she was awarded South Korea&#x2019;s Park Kyong-ni Prize for her contribution to international literature.

His debut collection, <i>The Shell Collector</i>, sets such high standards, sentence to sentence, that it is more like the private architecture of shells than like the random borrowings, sexual details, and flashes of insight that make up the bulk of contemporary fiction. The title story is about a blind man of 58, a scholar of shells (malacology), who retires to an isolated beach-side hut in Kenya, but then accidentally discovers a cure for a major illness in the often-deadly stings of the cone snail. "The Hunter's Wife," a second small masterpiece, describes the marriage of a Montana hunter and his much younger, psychically gifted wife. There are more conventional pieces here; well-written, resonating stories that do not attempt the sweep or descriptive wealth of "The Shell Collector," although they are still at the level of the best realistic fiction that is being published now in America. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Anthony Doerr has won numerous prizes for his fiction, including the 2015 Pulitzer Prize.

Given that assessment, it is interesting that the invention was so long in arriving. Its roots dated back to the American Revolution, but for more than a century, inventors faced ridicule and contempt ... The transition of America from horse-drawn to horse-less society boasts an epic cast of characters - from stalwart heros to dastardly scoundrels, from social grandees to street toughs, from wise men to wise guys." </p><p>This "cast of characters" provides the lens through which award-winning author Beverly Rae Kimes focuses on the early years of the American automobile industry. While some names - Ford, Dodge, Buick, and more - are easily recognized, this book also introduces snapshots of lesser known, but vitally important actors in this dramatic saga. The famous, the infamous, and the unknown are brought together by their common dedication to this great invention - and united by the fascinating stories that characterize each person. </p><p>This book presents a unique and engagingly written portrait of the American automobile industry's early years, focusing on the individuals who dreamed, schemed, innovated, succeeded and failed in their quests for fame, fortune, glory, and knowledge. This is a book that tells a story like no other - a history of America, Americans, and their love affair with the "horse-less carriage." </p><p>Did you know? </p><p>The first company to build automobiles was organized by Oliver Evans in 1804. <br>In 1900 the gasoline car was third in popularity, behind steamer and electric models. <br>In 1909 Henry Ford briefly considered becoming part of General Motors. <br>In 1916 Lt.

It's very difficult to keep track of who is who early on, and so at the end knowing who lived or died is impossible.<p> The idea of alien mind parasites is nice if unoriginal, and the two robotic guardian-types were also neat, but their function in the novel is unclear. The new companion character Fitz remains something of an enigma, although he does have some nice moments and some interesting defining characteristics. </p><p> There are some good ideas in <i>The Taint</i>, but unfortunately the writing never manages to rise above the level of competent, and the plot gets a little submerged under a surfeit of characters.

He and his wife, author Phyllis Rose, divide their time among Key West, New York City, and Connecticut.Echoing recent political change and prescribing more peaceable strategies, Brunhoff adds still another episode to the annals of the popular elephant king. Urged by an evil witch, rhinoceros King Rataxes plots against Babar; he invites him to dine, but enjoys Babar's company so much that he forgets to have his soldiers take him prisoner. Next he steals the elephants' water and forces them into battle. Calling for single combat, Babar defeats the rhino (who has seized the advantage of having his back to the sun) by dazzling him with light reflected from his shield. Rataxes apologizes, disarms, and (in an all-too-human touch) scapegoats the witch: ``It isn't my fault.'' Pleasantly predictable. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

So writes William Burt in this remarkably absorbing and resonant account of his years spent in pursuit of photographs of rails - tiny, elusive marsh birds that are nearly impossible to find, let alone photograph. Shadowbirds chronicles his quest: the cameras that would not fire, the suspicious onlookers encountering Burt and his apparatus on deserted roadsides, the countless near-misses that make this chronicle of a self-imposed challenge, and his ultimate success, sometimes hilarious, sometimes heartbreaking, but always provocative and delightful.Yet Shadowbirds is more than the story of a single-minded search for birds. Indeed, it is the tale of the age-old human quest for things, elusive, mysterious, unattainable - a story as old as the Holy Grail and as current as our own dreams. All readers will find something of themselves in William Burt, whether they seek birds or other things. No one can fail to be captivated by this sensitive and telling book. (71/4 X 91/2, 186 pages, color photos, b&amp;w photos)<br>Lovely anecdotal moments in pursuit of the furtive rail, from a wildlife photographer so deeply under the bird's spell that sometimes you wonder if he was dealt a full deck. Burt's mission was to photograph two fairly drab, songless birds: the black rail, citizen of the salt marsh, small of stature, notoriously stealthy; and its yellow cousin, no less elusive, but happier in fresh water. Both birds are airborne misfits, preferring to walk, thus they are stalked late at night by their calls (the black sounds froggy, the yellow like a typewriter). In the dark, with the black rail making off through the grass and the yellow melting away through the straw, the job is long, hard, and more often than not without reward. Burt takes in stride mosquito swarms, quicksand, and encounters with drunken teenage yahoos, managing to bring an air of indolence to the task; he digests it all at a wonderfully sedate pace. He recounts his tales in an appealing, graceful, old-fart style, occasionally waxing acerbic-- he takes to task two nonagenarians out adding to their life lists for being uninspired--but only enough to keep the narrative from getting flabby. And Burt knows how to laugh at himself, as in his description of a quest in the backwaters of North Dakota for the lost hunting grounds of Reverend P.B. Peabody, turn-of-the-century bermensch of yellow rail birders. In the end, the author got his photographs of the nocturnal skulkers, although at the rate of about one a year. It's impressive enough that Burt has fashioned mysterious and engaging creatures out of a couple of eccentric birds. Add to that an absorbing storyline and a talent for depicting the places he roams, and this modest book takes on rather grand proportions.

This book is an anthropological inquiry into a contemporary social enigma-the increasingly popular revival of ancient human decoration practices such as symbolic/deeply personal tattooing, multiple piercings, and ritual scarification. "Primitive" actions which rupture conventional confines of behavior &amp; aesthetics are objectively scrutinized. In context of the death of global frontiers, this volume charts the territory of the last remaining underdeveloped source of first-hand experience: the human body.</p><p>MODERN PRIMITIVES #12 Modern Primitives examines a vivid contemporary enigma: the growing revival of highly visual (and sometimes shocking) "primitive" body modification practices-tattooing, multiple piercing, and scarification. Perhaps Nietzsche has an explanation: "One of the things that may drive thinkers to despair is the recognition f the fact that the illogical is necessary for man and that out of the illogical comes much that is good. It is so firmly rooted in the passions, in language, in art, in religion and generally in everything that gives value to life, that it cannot be withdrawn without thereby injuring all these beautiful things. It is only the all-too-naive person who can believe that the nature of man can be changed into a purely logical one." <p>Civilization, with its emphasis on logic, may be stifling and life-thwarting, yet a clich-ridden illusion as to what is "primitive" provides no solution to the problem: how do we achieve an integration of the poetic and scientific imagination in our lives? There are pitfalls on both sides, and what is absolutely not intended is any romanticization of "nature" or "primitive society." After all, advances in science and technology have eliminated much mind-numbing repetitive labor, and inventions such as the inexpensive microcomputer have opened up unprecedented possibilities for individual creative expression. </p><p>Obviously, it is impossible to return to an authentic "primitive" society. Those such as the Tasaday in the Philippines and the Dayaks in Borneo are irrevocably contaminated. Besides having been dubiously idealized and only partially understood in the first place, under scrutiny many "primitive" societies reveal forms of repression and coercion (such as the Yanoamo, who ritually bash each other's heads in, and African groups who practice clitoridectomy-removal of the clitoris) which would be unbearable to emancipated individuals of today. What is implied by the revival of "modern primitive" activities is the desire for, and the dream of, a more ideal society. </p><p>Amidst an almost universal feeling of powerlessness to "change the world," individuals are changing what they do have power over: their own bodies. That shadowy zone between the physical and the psychic is being probed for whatever insight and freedom may be reclaimed. By giving visible bodily expression to unknown desires and latent obsessions welling up from within individuals can provoke change-however inexplicable-in the external world of the social, besides freeing up a creative part of themselves; some part of their essence. (However, generalized proselytization has no place here-some people should definitely not get tattoos. Having a piercing is no infallible indication of advanced consciousness; as Anton LaVey remarked, "I've known plenty of people who have had tattooing and all kinds of modifications to their bodies-who are really screwed up!") </p><p>Art has always mirrored the zeitgeist of the time. In this Postmodern epoch in which all the art of the past has been assimilated, consumerized, advertised and replicated, the last artistic territory resisting co-optation and commodification by Museum and Gallery remains the Human Body. For a tattoo is more than a painting on skin; its meaning and reverberations cannot be comprehended without a knowledge of the history and mythology of its bearer. Thus it is a true poetic creation, and is always more than meets the eye. As a tattoo is grounded on living skin, so its essence emotes a poignancy unique to the mortal human condition. Likewise, no two piercings can be identical, because no two faces, bodies or genitalia are alike. </p><p>These body modifications perform a vital function identical with art: they "genuinely stimulate passion and spring directly from the original sources of emotion, and are not something tapped from the cultural reservoir." (Roger Cardinal) Here that neglected function of art: to stimulate the mind, is unmistakably alive. And all of these modifications bear witness to personal pain endured which cannot be simulated. Although . . . society's machinery of co-optation gets faster and faster: a recent issue of New York Woman reported the marketing of non-piercing nipple rings ranging from $26.50 to $10,000! No doubt further attempts at commercialization lie just around the corner . . . </p><p>This book presents a wide range of rationales, ranging from the functional ("The ampallang makes sex much better!") to the extravagantly poetic and metaphysical. The archetypes have been investigated; nevertheless, numerous practitioners are absent-it was simply not possible to interview everyone of relevance. Many of the subjects started their experiments as children: before he was 12, Ed Hardy had begun coloring "tattoos" on his peers; Fakir Musafar was enacting various primitive rituals borrowed from National Geographic by the age of 14. All share in common a creative imperative to which they have yielded in a kind of ultimate commitment: they have granted their own bodies as the artistic medium of expression. </p><p>Increasingly, the necessity to prove to the self the authenticity of unique, thoroughly private sensation becomes a threshold more difficult to surmount. Today, something as basic as sex itself is inextricably intertwined with a flood of alien images and cues implanted from media programming and advertising. But one thing remains fairly certain: pain is a uniquely personal experience; it remains loaded with tangible shock value. The most extreme practitioners of SM probe the psychic territory of pain in search of an "ultimate," mystical proof that in their relationship (between the "S" and the "M"), the meaning of "trust" has been explored to its final limits, stopping just short of the infliction/experiencing of death itself. </p><p>All the "modern primitive" practices being revived-so-called "permanent" tattooing, piercing, and scarification-underscore the realization that death itself, the Grim Reaper, must be stared straight in the face, unflinchingly, as part of the continuing struggle to free ourselves from our complexes, to get to know our hidden instincts, to work out unaccountable aggressions and satisfy devious urges. Death remains the standard whereby the authenticity and depth of all activities may be judged. And [complex] eroticism has always been the one implacable enemy of death. It is necessary to uncover the mass of repressed desires lying within the unconscious so that a New Eroticism embracing the common identity of pain and pleasure, delirium and reason, and founded on a full knowledge of evil and perversion, may arise to inspire radically improved social relations. </p><p>All sensual experience functions to free us from "normal" social restraints, to awaken our deadened bodies to life. All such activity points toward a goal: the creation of the "complete" or "integrated" man and woman, and in this we are yet prisoners digging an imaginary tunnel to freedom. Our most inestimable resource, the unfettered imagination, continues to be grounded in the only truly precious possession we can ever have and know, and which is ours to do with what we will: the human body.-V.Vale &amp; Andrea Juno</p></p><h2>Wild in the Hollow: On Chasing Desire and Finding the Broken Way Home</h2><p>Amber Haines is a woman haunted by God.

It includes works by two Nobel prize winners for literature, Oe and Kawabata, offers stories by such acclaimed writers as Mishima, Murakami, and Tanizaki, and offers stories by some of the most talented Japanese women writers of today: Hirabayashi, Euchi, Okamoto, and Hayashi. Uniquely comprehensive, this collection gives an excellent overview of the history of short fiction writing in modern Japan. It is organized chronologically, beginning with the first writing to assimilate and rework Western literary conventions. It then moves through the flourishing of the genre in the Taisho era, to the new breed of writers produced under the constraints of censorship in the period just before and during World War II, and the current writings that, much like their Western equivalents, reflect the pitfalls and paradoxes of modern life.<br> The most complete and compelling collection of its kind available, <em>The Oxford Book of Japanese Short Stories</em> exhibits various indigenous traditions, in addition to those drawn from the West, that recur throughout the stories, Here, for example, are stories of the self, of the Water Trade (Tokyo's nightlife of geishas and prostitutes), of social comment, love and obsession, legends and fairytales. Both stimulating and fascinating, this comprehensive collection offers superb guidance to a tradition little known in America.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>Theodore Goossen</strong> is Professor of Japanese at York University, Ontario.

He was largely forgotten during the twentieth century&#x2015;though he continued to influence popular culture (the iconic image of a woman tied to railway tracks as a train rushes towards her, for example, originates in a Boucicault melodrama). In the twenty-first century the gripping nature of his plays is being discovered afresh; when <em>The Octoroon</em> was produced as a BBC Radio play in 2012, director and playwright Mark Ravenhill described Boucicault&#x2019;s dramas as &#x201c;the precursors to Hollywood cinema.&#x201d; </p> <p> In <em>The Octoroon</em>&#x2015;the most controversial play of his career&#x2015;Boucicault addresses the sensitive topic of race and slavery. George Peyton inherits a plantation, and falls in love with an octoroon&#x2015;a person one-eighth African American, and thus, in 1859 Louisiana, legally a slave. <em>The Octoroon</em> opened in 1859 in New York City, just two years prior to the American Civil War, and created a sensation&#x2015;as it did in its subsequent British production. </p> <p> This new edition includes a wide range of background contextual materials, an informative introduction, and extensive annotation. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Sarika Bose</strong>, a Lecturer in the Department of English at the University of British Columbia, specializes in Victorian drama. </p><p> &#x201c;With this useful edition, my students can for the first time read a range of documents, brought together in one edition, recounting the drama&#x2019;s staging and reception.

The stunning defeat of Japanese forces at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November marked the turning point in the war against Japan and the start of an offensive in the Central Solomons aimed at New Georgia.<i> New Georgia: The Second Battle</i> for the Solomons tells the story of the land, sea, and air battles fought there from March through October 1943. Making careful and copious use of both Japanese and Allied sources, Ronnie Day masterfully weaves the intricate threads of these battles into a well-crafted narrative of this pivotal period in the war. As Day makes clear, combat in the Solomons exemplified the war in the Pacific, especially the importance of air power, something the Japanese failed to understand until it was too late, and the strategy of island hopping, bypassing Japanese strongholds (including Rabaul) in favor of weaker or more strategically advantageous targets. This multifaceted account gives the fighting for New Georgia its proper place in the history of the drive to break the Japanese defensive perimeter and bring the homeland within range of Allied bombers.</p></p><p><p>Ronnie Day (1939&#x2013;2014) was Professor in the Department of History at East Tennessee State University.

He studied at Cambridge but left without his degree to volunteer for service in the Crimean War. After several failed attempts at careers, he decided in 1865 to become a writer, beginning as a correspondent for the <em>Standard</em>. He wrote his first boys' adventure, <em>Out of the Pampas, </em> in 1868, and its popularity spurred him to write some eighty more children's books. Drawing on his own experiences fighting in the Crimean War and as a foreign correspondent in Europe and Africa, Henty fashioned stories for children that combined realism and what he called a "manly tone." His novels encompass an array of times and places from the early days of Egypt to the mines of the California Gold Rush. He died in 1906, having left a legacy of 144 books and several short stories.</p>In this old-fashioned tale of incredible escapades, a lad accompanies Sir Frances Drake on several amazing voyages. One of G.A. Henty's classic historical novels for children, this story also provides adults a glimpse of the exciting but ruthless life on the high seas and unexplored lands of the sixteenth century. Although Fred Williams's manner might be a good match for the stilted, formal style of this nineteenth-century work, it's not pleasant for the listener. He employs the same stiff-upper-lip tone throughout narrative, dialogue, and journal writings. A few attempts at vocal characterization are oddly chosen and inconsistent.The flawed production overshadows the charm and exhilaration of this historical adventure.

On a beautiful night an owl sings to her owlet, a deer to his fawn, a whale to her calf. Animal parents sing this lullaby to their young, showing the universality of a parent&#39;s love for his or her child.

They have been published worldwide into over 20 languages. Jane created her first book &#x2018;Cat&#x2019;s Colours&#x2019; in 1996 whilst working as a graphic designer within children&#x2019;s publishing. She was fortunate enough to design the first picture books for some now highly respected author and illustrators.</p>This charming picture book opens with the first, familiar stanza of &#x201c;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,&#x201d; written more than 100 years ago by Jane Taylor, who is not credited here. Cabrera replaces the seldom-heard remaining verses with new ones, in which the star sparkles, flickers, and shimmers over different parts of the earth, such as forest, ocean, and desert. Each of the first nine double-page paintings features a little animal and its parent looking over a distinctive landscape while a bright-yellow star glows in the sky. The concluding stanza opens with the star shining down on the whole earth, seen from space. Although the text works fine for reading aloud, adults who sing the book aloud will probably stumble over the last stanza, which has eight four-beat lines rather than six. Musical notes and chord notations for the familiar tune are appended. Cabrera&#x2019;s distinctive paintings of baby animals and their parents create a riveting focus for young children, and the bold lines, energetic brushwork, and naive style should please their parents as well.

The nefarious witch trials in Salem, Massachusetts represent a low point of American history, made famous in works by Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne (himself a descendant of one of the judges), and Arthur Miller. The trials might have doomed Sewall to infamy except for a courageous act of contrition now commemorated in a mural that hangs beneath the golden dome of the Massachusetts State House picturing Sewall's public repentance. He was the only Salem witch judge to make amends.</p><p>But, remarkably, the judge's story didn't end there. Once he realized his error, Sewall turned his attention to other pressing social issues. Struck by the injustice of the New England slave trade, a commerce in which his own relatives and neighbors were engaged, he authored "The Selling of Joseph," America's first antislavery tract. While his peers viewed Native Americans as savages, Sewall advocated for their essential rights and encouraged their education, even paying for several Indian youths to attend Harvard College. Finally, at a time when women were universally considered inferior to <em>men</em>, Sewall published an essay affirming the fundamental equality of the sexes. The text of that essay, composed at the deathbed of his daughter Hannah, is republished here for the first time.</p><p>In <em>Salem Witch Judge</em>, acclaimed biographer Eve LaPlante, Sewall's great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter, draws on family lore, her ancestor's personal diaries, and archival documents to open a window onto life in colonial America, painting a portrait of a man traditionally vilified, but who was in fact an innovator and forefather who came to represent the best of the American spirit.</p></p><p><p>Eve LaPlante, a sixth great-granddaughter of Samuel Sewall, is the author of two previous critically acclaimed books: <em>American Jezebel</em>, a biography of her ancestor Anne Hutchinson, and <em>Seized</em>, a narrative portrait of temporal lobe epilepsy. LaPlante has degrees from Princeton and Harvard and has written for <em>The Atlantic</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Ladies' Home Journal</em>, and <em>Boston</em> magazine. She lives with her family in New England on land once owned by Judge Sewall. </p>In 1692, Salem magistrate Samuel Sewall (1652&#x2013;1730), along with several others, presided over the conviction and execution of 20 people accused of witchcraft. Five years and much soul-searching later, Sewall publicly repented of his part in the witch trials. Much as she did in <i>American Jezebel</i>, the marvelous biography of her 12th-generation ancestor Anne Hutchinson, LaPlante, who counts Sewall as her sixth-great-grandfather, richly narrates his life in its cultural and religious setting. Drawing on Sewall's diaries and stories told by her Aunt Charlotte, LaPlante sketches a compelling portrait of a committed family man, a dedicated magistrate and a deeply religious Puritan confronting his own shortcomings and questioning the doctrines of his religion. After his public repentance, Sewall reconsidered many Puritan teachings and wrote controversial treatises arguing for the equality of Native Americans, women and slaves. LaPlante's splendid biography brings a personal touch to Sewall's story (also recently recounted by historian Richard Francis in <i>Judge Sewall's Apology</i>, 2005) and his efforts to take the difficult but righteous path. <i>(Oct. 1)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tolken that the language, romance, and power of these great stories comes to life for modern readers, in this masterful and compelling new translation.</p><p><b>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</b> was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa. After serving in World War I, he embarked upon a distinguished academic career and was recognized as one of the finest philologists in the world. He was a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, a fellow of Pembroke College, and a fellow of Merton College until his retirement in 1959. He is, however, beloved throughout the world as the creator of Middle-earth and author of such classic works as <i>The Hobbit </i>and<i> </i>The Lord of the Rings. He died on September 2, 1973, at the age of eighty-one.When the siege and the assault had ceased at Troy,<br><br>and the fortress fell in flame to firebrands and ashes,<br><br>the traitor who the contrivance of treason there fashioned<br><br>was tried for his treachery, the most true upon earth&#x2014;<br><br>it was �neas the noble and his renowned kindred<br><br>who then laid under them lands, and lords became<br><br>of well-nigh all the wealth in the Western Isles.<br><br>When royal Romulus to Rome his road had taken,<br><br>in great pomp and pride he peopled it first,<br><br>and named it with his own name that yet now it bears;<br><br>Tirius went to Tuscany and towns founded,<br><br>Langaberde in Lombardy uplifted halls,<br><br>and far over the French flood Felix Brutus<br><br>on many a broad bank and brae Britain established<br><br>full fair,<br><br>where strange things, strife and sadness,<br><br>at whiles in the land did fare,<br><br>and each other grief and gladness<br><br>oft fast have followed there.<br><br>2<br><br>And when fair Britain was founded by this famous lord,<br><br>bold men were bred there who in battle rejoiced,<br><br>and many a time that betid they troubles aroused.<br><br>In this domain more marvels have by men been seen<br><br>than in any other that I know of since that olden time;<br><br>but of all that here abode in Britain as kings<br><br>ever was Arthur most honoured, as I have heard men tell.<br><br>Wherefore a marvel among men I mean to recall,<br><br>a sight strange to see some men have held it,<br><br>one of the wildest adventures of the wonders of Arthur.<br><br>If you will listen to this lay but a little while now,<br><br>I will tell it at once as in town I have heard<br><br>it told,<br><br>as it is fixed and fettered<br><br>in story brave and bold,<br><br>thus linked and truly lettered,<br><br>as was loved in this land of old.<br><br>3<br><br>This king lay at Camelot at Christmas-tide<br><br>with many a lovely lord, lieges most noble,<br><br>indeed of the Table Round all those tried brethren,<br><br>amid merriment unmatched and mirth without care.<br><br>There tourneyed many a time the trusty knights,<br><br>and jousted full joyously these gentle lords;<br><br>then to the court they came at carols to play.<br><br>For there the feast was unfailing full fifteen days,<br><br>with all meats and all mirth that men could devise,<br><br>such gladness and gaiety as was glorious to hear,<br><br>din of voices by day, and dancing by night;<br><br>all happiness at the highest in halls and in bowers<br><br>had the lords and the ladies, such as they loved most dearly.<br><br>With all the bliss of this world they abode together,<br><br>the knights most renowned after the name of Christ,<br><br>and the ladies most lovely that ever life enjoyed,<br><br>and he, king most courteous, who that court possessed.<br><br>For all that folk so fair did in their first estate<br><br>abide,<br><br>Under heaven the first in fame,<br><br>their king most high in pride;<br><br>it would now be hard to name<br><br>a troop in war so tried.<br><br>4<br><br>While New Year was yet young that yestereve had arrived,<br><br>that day double dainties on the dais were served,<br><br>when the king was there come with his courtiers to the hall,<br><br>and the chanting of the choir in the chapel had ended.<br><br>With loud clamour and cries both clerks and laymen<br><br>Noel announced anew, and named it full often;<br><br>then nobles ran anon with New Year gifts,<br><br>Handsels, handsels they shouted, and handed them out,<br><br>Competed for those presents in playful debate;<br><br>ladies laughed loudly, though they lost the game,<br><br>and he that won was not woeful, as may well be believed.<br><br>All this merriment they made, till their meat was served;<br><br>then they washed, and mannerly went to their seats,<br><br>ever the highest for the worthiest, as was held to be best.<br><br>Queen Guinevere the gay was with grace in the midst<br><br>of the adorned dais set.

A late starter, Baker published her first short stories in 1997, at the age of forty-five. From then until the end of her life, she wrote prolifically and well, leaving an astonishing body of work behind.<br><br>The Best of Kage Baker is a treasure trove that gathers together twenty stories and novellas, eleven of which have never been collected anywhere. The volume is bookended by a pair of tales from her best known and best loved creation: The Company, with its vivid cast of time traveling immortals. In 'Noble Mold,' Mendoza the botanist and Joseph, the ancient 'facilitator,' find themselves in 19th century California, where a straightforward acquisition grows unexpectedly complex, requiring, in the end, a carefully engineered 'miracle.' In 'The Carpet Beds of Sutro Park,' an autistic Company operative named Ezra encounters a lost soul named Kristy Ann, and finds a way to give her back the world that she has lost.<br><br>Among the volume's many other highlights are a pair of brilliant Company novellas: the Hugo Award-nominated 'Son, Observe the Time' and 'Welcome to Olympos, Mr. Hearst,' a tour de force set in the Hollywood of the 1930s and featuring an encounter with legendary newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. There is also a generous assortment of equally brilliant standalone tales, including 'Calamari Curls,' the account of a faded resort town that takes a surprising turn into Lovecraftian terrain, and the World Fantasy Award-nominated 'Caverns of Mystery,' in which ancient stories play themselves out repeatedly, shaping and altering the world around them.<br><br>These are only a few of the pleasures waiting within this book. The Best of Kage Baker is exactly what the title proclaims: the best short work of a gifted and irreplaceable writer. Anyone with an interest in first-rate imaginative fiction--anyone with an interest in lovingly crafted fiction of any kind--needs to read this book.</p><p></p><h2>On Heaven And Earth: Pope Francis</h2><p>On heaven and earth is an open and expansive dialogue between jorge mario bergoglio and abraham skorka, a rabbi and biophysicist, in which they share their thoughts on religion, reason, and the challenges the world faces in the 21st century. For years cardinal bergoglio (then archbishop of buenos aires) and rabbi skorka were tenacious promoters of interreligious dialogues on faith and reason. They both sought to build bridges between catholicism, judaism and the world at large. On heaven and earth brings together a series of these dialogues where both men talk about various theological and world issues including god, fundamentalism, atheism, abortion, homosexuality, euthanasia, same sex marriage and globalization. From these personal and accessible dialogues comes a first-hand view of the man who is now pope to 1. 2 billion catholics around the world.</p><p>Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires in 1936. He was elected Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 and was created cardinal by Pope Jean Paul II in 2001 with the title of cardinal priest of San Roberto Bellarmino, a church served by Jesuits. He was elected the 266th Pope in March 2013. Rabbi Abraham Skorka was born in Buenos Aires in 1950. He is Rector of the Latin American Rabbinical Seminary and has published numerous articles in the fields of Talmudic and Biblical research.<b>1. ON &nbsp;GOD</b><br><br><b>SKORKA</b>: It has been many years since we first met and a brotherly bond has been forged between us. &nbsp;While studying the books of the Talmud, I found one that says that friendship means sharing meals and spending time together, but in &nbsp;the &nbsp;end it points out that the sign of a real friendship is the ability to reveal what is in one's heart to the other person. That is what happened over time with the two of us. I believe that undoubtedly the most important thing that brought us together was, and still is, G-d, who caused our paths to cross and allowed us to open our hearts to each other. Although we broached many topics during our regular conversations, we never spoke explicitly about G-d. Of course, it was always understood that He was present. It would be good to start this exchange, which we plan to leave as a testimony of our dialogue, by &nbsp;discussing Him who is so important in our lives.<br><br><b>BERGOGLIO</b>: What a great word: <i>path!&nbsp; &nbsp;</i>In&nbsp; &nbsp;my personal experience with God&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot do without the path. I would say that one encounters God walking, moving, seeking Him and allowing oneself to be sought by Him. They are two paths that meet. On one hand, there is our path that seeks Him, driven by that instinct that flows from the heart; and after, when we have encountered each other, we realize that He was the one who had been searching for us from the start. The initial religious experience is that of walking: walk to the land that I am going to give you. &nbsp;It&nbsp; is &nbsp;a promise that God &nbsp;makes to Abraham. In that promise, in this, in this walking, an alliance is established that consolidates over&nbsp; &nbsp;time. Because of this I say that my experience with God takes place along the path, both in the search and in allowing myself to be sought, even if it may be by diverse paths-of pain, of joy, of light, or of darkness.<br><br> <b>SKORKA</b>: What you have said reminds me of a few biblical verses. For example, when G-d tells Abraham: "Walk in my presence and be blameless?' Or when the prophet Micah needed to explain to the Israelites what G-d wanted from them, and he tells them to "do &nbsp;justice and to &nbsp;love &nbsp;goodness, and to walk humbly with your G-d?'<br><br>Without a doubt, experiencing G-d &nbsp;is &nbsp;dynamic, &nbsp;to use a word that we &nbsp;learn in &nbsp;our mutual study of basic science. However, what do &nbsp;you &nbsp;think we &nbsp;can say &nbsp;to people nowadays when we &nbsp;find &nbsp;the idea of G-d &nbsp;to be so &nbsp;mangled, profaned and diminished in importance?<br><br> <b>BERGOGLIO</b>: What every person must be told is to look inside himself. Distraction is an interior fracture. It will never lead the person to encounter himself for it impedes him from looking into the mirror of his heart. Collecting oneself is the beginning. That is where the dialogue begins. At times, one believes He has the only answer, but that's not the case. I would tell &nbsp;the people of today to seek the &nbsp;experience of entering into the intimacy of their hearts, to know the experience, the face of God. That is why I love what Job says after his difficult experience and the dialogues that did &nbsp;not help him in &nbsp;any way: "By &nbsp;hearsay I had heard of you, &nbsp;but now my &nbsp;eye has seen you?' What I tell people is not to know God &nbsp;only by hearing. The Living God &nbsp;is He &nbsp;that you &nbsp;may see with your eyes within your heart.<br><br> <b>SKORKA</b>: The Book of Job teaches us a great lesson because-in short-it says that we &nbsp;can never know how G-d&nbsp; &nbsp;reveals Himself in specific circumstances. Job, &nbsp;a just, upright man, wanted to know why he had lost everything, even his health. His &nbsp;friends told &nbsp;him that G-d &nbsp;had punished him for &nbsp;his sins. He &nbsp;responds by &nbsp;saying that even if he had sinned, he had not been <i>that </i>bad. Job &nbsp;is comforted only when G-d &nbsp;appears &nbsp;to him. His&nbsp; &nbsp;questions are not answered, but the touch of G-d's presence stays with him. We can find several things in this story that shape my &nbsp;personal perception of G-d. First, Job's friends show themselves to &nbsp;be &nbsp;arrogant and nonsensical by &nbsp;espousing the theory that "You &nbsp;have sinned, therefore G-d &nbsp;has punished you," transforming G-d&nbsp; &nbsp;into some &nbsp;sort of &nbsp;computer that calculates reward or &nbsp;punishment. At &nbsp;the end of &nbsp;the story, G-d &nbsp;tells Job-who &nbsp;had railed so &nbsp;much against the injustices of his Creator-that he should intercede and pray for&nbsp; &nbsp;his friends, because they had spoken falsely about Him. Those who had cried out in suffering, demanding heavenly justice, were pleasing in G-d's eyes. Those who insisted on a simplistic view of G-d's nature were detested by &nbsp;Him. As I &nbsp;understand it, &nbsp;G-d &nbsp;reveals Himself to &nbsp;us subtly. Our current suffering might be &nbsp;an answer for&nbsp; &nbsp;others in the future. Or, &nbsp;perhaps we &nbsp;ourselves are the response to &nbsp;some� thing from the past. In &nbsp;Judaism, G-d &nbsp;is honored by our compliance with the precepts that he revealed. As you &nbsp;mentioned, each person and each generation must find the path on &nbsp;which they can search for &nbsp;and feel &nbsp;His &nbsp;presence.<br><br> <b>BERGOGLIO</b>: Exactly. We &nbsp;receive creation in &nbsp;our&nbsp; hands as a gift. God &nbsp;gives it to us, &nbsp;but at the same time He gives us a task: that we subdue the Earth. This is the first form of non-culture: what man receives, the raw material that ought to &nbsp;be &nbsp;subdued to &nbsp;make culture� like &nbsp;the log &nbsp;that is &nbsp;transformed into a table. But there is a moment in which man goes too far &nbsp;in this task; he gets overly zealous and loses respect for &nbsp;nature. Then ecological problems arise, like global warming, which are new forms of non-culture. The work of man before God &nbsp;and before himself must maintain a constant bal� ance between the &nbsp;gift &nbsp;and the task. When man keeps the gift &nbsp;alone and does not do &nbsp;the &nbsp;work, he does not complete his&nbsp; &nbsp;mission and remains primitive; when man becomes overly zealous with his work, he forgets about the gift, &nbsp;creating a constructivist ethic: he thinks that everything is the fruit of his labor and that there is no gift. It is what I call &nbsp;the Babel syndrome.<br><br> <b>SKORKA</b>: In &nbsp;rabbinic literature, there is a question as to why G-d &nbsp;did &nbsp;not like the Tower of Babel. Why did he halt construction by making people speak different languages? In reading the text, the simplest explanation is that the attempt to build a tower reaching Heaven was part of a pagan religion. The act was an expression of arrogance toward g-d. The <i>Midrash</i> states that what really bothered g-d was that the &nbsp;builders were more concerned about losing a single brick than with losing a &nbsp;man who might fall &nbsp;from such a &nbsp;great height. The same thing happens now-there &nbsp;is &nbsp;a &nbsp;tension between the &nbsp;gift and the &nbsp;work. There needs to be a perfect equilibrium because man needs to progress so that he &nbsp;can become more human. Even though g-d is the &nbsp;one who planted and created everything, man is the &nbsp;focus of the &nbsp;material world and the &nbsp;greatest divine work. The way we &nbsp;are living today, the &nbsp;only thing that matters is &nbsp;the &nbsp;success of &nbsp;our economic system, and what is least important is the &nbsp;well-being of mankind.<br><br> <b>BERGOGLIO</b>: what you &nbsp;have said is brilliant. The Babel syndrome is &nbsp;not &nbsp;only a &nbsp;constructivist posture, but &nbsp;there is also the &nbsp;appearance of a confusion of languages. That is typical of situations in &nbsp;which there is an exaggeration of the &nbsp;mission, ignoring the &nbsp;gift, &nbsp;be- cause in&nbsp; that case pure constructivism carries with it the &nbsp;lack of dialogue that at &nbsp;the &nbsp;same time entails aggression, misinformation, and annoyance . . . when one reads Maimonides14 and Saint Thomas of Aquinas, two&nbsp; &nbsp;nearly contemporary philosophers, we&nbsp; &nbsp;see&nbsp; &nbsp;that they always start by putting themselves in the &nbsp;position of their adversary in &nbsp;order to &nbsp;understand them; they dialogue from the &nbsp;standpoint of the &nbsp;other.<br><br> <b>SKORKA</b>: according &nbsp;to &nbsp;the&nbsp; &nbsp;Talmudic interpretation, nimrod was a &nbsp;Babylonian dictator who held a tight grip on &nbsp;everything, and that is &nbsp;why the &nbsp;people spoke only one language-his. This tyrant ordered the construction of a tower that would reach Heaven in order &nbsp;to leave his &nbsp;mark, and thus, presumed rather arrogantly to &nbsp;be &nbsp;physically closer to &nbsp;g-d. The point of building was not &nbsp;to benefit mankind. The betterment of people's lives held no &nbsp;importance. By building only for themselves while using one despotic language and not&nbsp; &nbsp;a &nbsp;universal one, each person was punished by being made to speak a language that no one else &nbsp;could understand. This is a very important story and it is always incredibly relevant.</p><h2>Train Was On Time</h2><p>B�ll&#39;s novel blows a stent in the human heart. . .

But history teaches us that these great crises also represent opportunities to remake our economy and society and to generate whole new eras of economic growth and prosperity. In terms of innovation, invention, and energetic risk taking, these periods of "creative destruction" have been some of the most fertile in history, and the changes they put into motion can set the stage for full-scale recovery.<br><br>In <b>The Great Reset</b>, bestselling author and economic development expert Richard Florida provides an engaging and sweeping examination of these previous economic epochs, or "resets." He distills the deep forces that have altered physical and social landscapes and eventually reshaped economies and societies. Looking toward the future, Florida identifies the patterns that will drive the next Great Reset and transform virtually every aspect of our lives &#x2014; from how and where we live, to how we work, to how we invest in individuals and infrastructure, to how we shape our cities and regions. Florida shows how these forces, when combined, will spur a fresh era of growth and prosperity, define a new geography of progress, and create surprising opportunities for all of us. Among these forces will be<br><br>* new patterns of consumption, and new attitudes toward ownership that are less centered on houses and cars<br>* the transformation of millions of service jobs into middle class careers that engage workers as a source of innovation<br>* new forms of infrastructure that speed the movement of people, goods, and ideas<br>* a radically altered and much denser economic landscape organized around "megaregions" that will drive the development of new industries, new jobs, and a whole new way of life<br><br>We've weathered tough times before.

In between are double-page spreads that show individual children in their costumes on the left and an illustration of the costume in progress or its inspiration on the right. For example, Jessica is Comet Queen just like the television show, while Evan wears an astronaut suit that he made in the kitchen with his father.

Timothy, Titus, and Sarah-Jane, from the Three Cousins Detective Club series, return in their ninth adventure. This time they travel to see a genuine powwow, where Timothy finally has the opportunity to meet his Native American pen pal, Anthony Two-Trees, who will be competing in the dance. In preparation for their trip, the cousins learn all they can about the spectacular and valuable ceremonial garb and its chief decorative component, eagle feathers, the possession of which is strictly regulated by U.S. law. No sooner do the children arrive than they learn that feathers are disappearing from the outfits. Some clever detective work by the cousins confirms that someone is stealing the feathers to sell on the black market.

Why do people get so emotional and irrational about bottom-line financial and business decisions? Is the capitalist marketplace a sort of Darwinian organism, evolved through natural selection as the fittest way to satisfy our needs? In this eye-opening exploration, author and psychologist Michael Shermer uncovers the evolutionary roots of our economic behavior.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on the new field of neuroeconomics, Shermer investigates what brain scans reveal about bargaining, snap purchases, and establishing trust in business. He scrutinizes experiments in behavioral economics to understand why people hang on to losing stocks, why negotiations disintegrate into tit-for-tat disputes, and why money does not make us happy. He brings together astonishing findings from psychology, biology, and other sciences to describe how our tribal ancestry makes us suckers for brands, why researchers believe cooperation unleashes biochemicals similar to those released during sex, why free trade promises to build alliances between nations, and how even capuchin monkeys get indignant if they don't get a fair reward for their work.</p><p><p>Michael Shermer is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior.

If you walk into a Yanomam� village and count up the stone tools, baskets, arrow points, arrow shafts, bows, cotton yarn, cotton and vine hammocks, clay pots, assorted other tools, various medicinal remedies, pets, food products, articles of clothing, and the like, you would end up with a figure of around three hundred. Before ten thousand years ago, this was the approximate material wealth of every village on the planet. If our species is about a hundred thousand years old, then 90 percent of our history has been spent in this state of relative economic simplicity.1</p><p>Living along the Hudson River that borders New York and New Jersey are the Manhattan people, consumer-traders whose average annual income has been estimated at $40,000 per person per year. If you walk into the Manhattan village and count up all the different products available at retail stores and restaurants, factory outlets, and superstores, you would end up with a figure of around ten billion. This is a mind-boggling comparison, first made by the economist Eric Beinhocker in his comprehensive study The Origin of Wealth. Something happened over the last ten thousand years to increase the average annual income of hunter-gatherers by four hundred times.</p><p>As remarkable as this jump in income is, it pales in comparison to the differences between hunter-gatherers and consumer-traders in terms of product count, which in modern economics is measured in Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs, a retail measure of the number of types of products available in a store. By one estimate, for example, seven hundred new products are introduced into the market every day, a quarter of a million a year. In 2005, there were 26,893 new food and household products alone, including 187 new breakfast cereals, 303 new women&#x2019;s fragrances, and 115 new deodorants. Between the Yanomam�&#x2019;s three hundred SKUs and the Manhattans&#x2019; ten billion SKUs is a difference of 33 million times.2</p><p>This difference of 400 times in income and 33 million times in products almost beggars description. We need analogies to get our minds around this staggering disparity. One contrast of the income difference: at its widest point, Manhattan island is 3.7 kilometers across, a distance you could easily walk in less than an hour while window shopping and skyscraper gazing. Multiply that figure by 400 and you get 1,480 kilometers, or slightly more than the distance from New York to Atlanta, which would take you 261 hours (10.9 days) to walk at a comfortable pace without stopping. Even more dramatic is a comparison of the SKU difference. The length of Manhattan is 21.5 kilometers. Multiply that by 33 million and you get a figure of 709,500,000 kilometers, or the approximate distance between Earth and Jupiter when both planets are in their orbits on the same side of the sun. You can walk the length of Manhattan in a day, but even traveling at the breakneck speed of a little over 51,000 kilometers per hour, it took the Voyager I spacecraft a year and a half to get to Jupiter.3</p><p>If ever there was a great leap forward, this was it, comparable to the evolution of bipedalism, the big brain, and consciousness, equivalent to the invention of fire, the printing press, and the Internet, and on par with the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and the Digital Revolution. And this great leap did not happen gradually. It has been estimated that the $100 per person annual income had risen only to about $150 per person by 1000 BCE&#x2014;the end of the Bronze Age and the time of King David&#x2014;and did not exceed $200 per person per annum until after 1750 and the onset of the Industrial Revolution. In other words, it took 97,000 years to go from $100 to $150 per person per year, then another 2,750 years to climb to $200 per person per year, and, finally, 250 years to ascend to today&#x2019;s level of $6,600 per person per year for the entire world&#x2014;and as we just saw, an order of magnitude higher still for the wealthiest people in the richest nations. If we compressed that 100,000-year period into just one year, then the last 250-year period of relative prosperity would represent less than one day out of the year. Or, if we condensed the hundred millennia into one 24-hour day, our epoch of industrial production and market economies accounts for a mere 3.6 minutes. In other words, the age in which we live and take for granted as normal and the way things have always been, in fact constitutes a mere one-quarter of one percent of the history of humanity.</p><p>How and why did humans make this great economic leap? We can answer this question by employing the methods and findings of science from a number of related and revolutionary new fields, including complexity theory, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary economics, behavioral economics, neuroeconomics, and virtue economics. We need all of these new fields&#x2014;along with those from the traditional sciences&#x2014;brought to bear on this question because it remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of our time.</p><p>For simplicity&#x2019;s sake, I shall lump all of these sciences under the rubric of Evolutionary Economics&#x2014;the study of the economy as an evolving complex adaptive system grounded in a human nature that evolved functional adaptations to survival as a social primate species in the Paleolithic epoch in which we evolved. This is a swanky way of saying that the economy is a very complex system that changed and adapted to circumstances as it evolved out of a much simpler system, that we spent the first ninety thousand years of our life as hunter-gatherers living in small bands, and that this environment created a psychology not always well equipped to understand or live in the modern world. In essence, in trying to explain the Great Leap Forward, I am addressing three problems about the mind of the market:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How the market has a mind of its own&#x2014;that is, how economies evolved from hunter-gathering to consumer-trading.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How minds operate in markets&#x2014;that is, how the human brain evolved to operate in a hunter-gatherer economy but must function in a consumer-trader economy.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How minds and markets are moral&#x2014;that is, how moral emotions evolved to enable us to cooperate and how this capacity facilitates fair and free trade.</p><p>This is a really hard problem to solve.</p><p>Ever since I took a course in astronomy at the start of my college education, I have noticed a disturbing tendency on the part of both the scientific community and the culture at large to rank the sciences from &#x201c;hard&#x201d; (the physical sciences, such as astronomy, physics, and chemistry) to &#x201c;medium&#x201d; (the biological sciences, such as anatomy, physiology, and zoology) to &#x201c;soft&#x201d; (the social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, and anthropology). History was not even considered a science, and economics was off in its own land in the balkanized world of academia. And as rankings are wont to be, this hierarchy includes an assessment of worth, with the hard sciences being the most worthy and the soft sciences the least, accompanied by corresponding levels of recognition and support. Yet, having had some training in the physical and biological sciences, and extensive education and experience in the social sciences, I have always felt that the rank order is precisely reversed.</p><p>The physical sciences are hard in the sense that calculating differential equations is difficult, for example; but the subject matter itself is relatively easy to define and explain when compared to the considerably more complex and interconnected world of life and ecosystems. Yet even the difficulty of constructing a comprehensive theory of biology&#x2014;which still remains a knotty problem in the life sciences&#x2014;is pallid in comparison to that of the workings of human brains and societies. In my opinion, the social sciences are the hard sciences, because our subject matter is orders of magnitude more complex and multifaceted.</p><p>In the neurosciences, the study of consciousness has come to be known as &#x201c;the hard problem&#x201d;4 because it has been so difficult to explain how the activity of billions of individual neurons generates the collective phenomenon of conscious thought, or what one scientist calls the &#x201c;society of mind.&#x201d;5 An even harder problem&#x2014;what I call the really hard problem&#x2014;is for science to explain how the activity of billions of individual humans generates the collective phenomenon of culture, or the &#x201c;society of culture,&#x201d; and what its proper economic and political structure should be to achieve social harmony.</p><p>As humans made the transition from hunter-gatherers to consumer-traders, groups have tried hundreds of different social experiments in an attempt to solve the really hard problem. Bands, tribes, chiefdoms, states, and empires have been formed. Theocracies, plutocracies, monarchies, and democracies have been tried. Tribalism, statism, socialism, and now globalism have been practiced. From no trade to fair trade to free trade, endless permutations of economic arrangements have been employed, with greater and lesser success. And for millennia, philosophers and scholars from all walks of life and from around the world have attempted to solve the really hard problem with little consensus.

She died of cancer at 37, never knowing that they had seen that image or that it had been crucial to their breakthrough. Neither idealizing Franklin nor downplaying her importance, Polcovar writes a rattling good story on two fronts: a woman becoming a scientist in an age when that was still unusual and the complex dynamics of personalities in a field sometimes thought of as impersonal. The author very clearly explains the personality clashes in the lab and the competitive environment in the scientific community that preceded that DNA announcement as well as the efforts, begun soon after her death and still continuing, to give Franklin full recognition for her part in that discovery. Illustrated mainly with photos, some in color, this absorbing biography concludes with a time line, source notes, recommended Internet sites, and a bibliography. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It's an overwhelming and life-altering blend of fright and fascination that leaves us in a state of puzzled apprehension and appreciative perplexed wonder. If we go beyond a kind of ignorant distant voyeurism through which we gawk at life rather than fully engage with it and put in the effort to try to understand a little more about life's meaning, awe becomes less a feeling of being high and more a feeling of deep immersion in any and all of life's processes, including health, illness, love, and even death. It may not cause us to come to believe in something, but it can cause us to believe that there is something more beyond the grasp of our limited human consciousness. It can turn our stress into motivation for growth, solidify our commitment to our families as systems that can experience collective awe together, and help us find meaning, comprehensibility, and manageability at times of our most profound losses and even our own death.' </p> <p>&#x2015;from Awe: The Delights and Dangers of Our Eleventh Emotion </p> <p>Lyrical, eye-opening, and highly perceptive with unexpected twists and turns as grand as awe itself, Awe is an invitation to leave our states of languishing and to flourish; however, the choice is ultimately yours as to what to do with your eleventh emotion, its delights and dangers, and what you choose to make of it. </p></p><p>Paul Pearsall, Ph.D., (1942-2007) was a board-certified Clinical Neuropsychologist, clinical professor at the University of Hawaii , and sat on the board of directors for the State of Hawaii Consortium for Integrative Medicine. Dr. Pearsall authored more than nineteen books, many of which were #1 New York Times bestsellers, including Super Immunity, The Power of the Family, Toxic Success, The Heart&#39;s Code, The Pleasure Prescription, The Beethoven Factor, and The Last Self-Help Book You&#39;ll Ever Need.<p>The Choice of a Lifetime<br>'Awe: Mysterium tremendium et facinas'<br>&#x2015;Rudolf Otto<br><br>Faith in the Mysterious<br>Imagine that you were given the choice of a lifetime&#x2015;the choice between an easy life and a difficult life. The easy life would be interesting; moreover, it would be relatively stress free and calmly predictable. An unshakable explanatory system would provide a safety net when crisis happened, and nothing astonishingly and perplexingly wonderful would ever mess up your thinking. Horrible and/or challenging life events would not keep defying how you see and understood life. The other, more difficult life would be vastly more enthralling, but also full of tremendous mysteries and would sometimes send you down into the depths of confused depression, even as it lifted you to the strange elation that life can be so magnificent and powerfully confusing. This difficult life would consist of constantly searching for the meaning of life and how life should be lived and understood, and would prompt you to totally rearrange your life and how you view it. Which would you choose? This is a book about what happens if you could make the second choice or, as often happens, have that kind of life imposed upon you by events that lead to undeniably true and deep awe. It's about a life full of moments of powerful and transformative emotions that frequently send chills down our spines, fill our eyes with tears, cause our hearts to race, make the hair on the backs of our necks stand on end, boggle the mind, and literally take our breath away&#x2015;in other words, a life full of awe.<br><br>This book makes the case for the valuable irresistible fascination, the highest elation, and sometimes a most profound sadness that leaves us in a state of puzzled apprehension, perplexing dread, yet appreciative wonder and hope regarding the vast mysteries of life that is known as awe. But be warned: Choosing or having imposed upon you the more difficult, challenging, awe-inspired life won't always be what most people might call 'a good life,' even though it is guaranteed to be a full life. It will be far from an easy life, but it will be an unimaginably intense one that may not leave you feeling better but will leave you feeling in ways that you may never have imagined possible.<br><br>What is so difficult about living a life filled with awe? The kind of awe, as experienced by hundreds of people who describe their experiences with this most unique of human responses in the following pages, is much more than appreciating beauty found in nature, having a temporarily reverent religious experience, or experiencing what is being described by the increasingly ubiquitous word 'awesome.' It is a mystical feeling that seems to be capable of incorporating almost all of our other emotions. It's as 'real' as our experience of life ever gets&#x2015;so real, in fact, that it overwhelms you like no other emotion and, like passionate lovemaking, can leave you feeling drained as much as inspired.<br><br>Although intense contemplation of its meaning can end up deepening it, awe often shakes our faith and disturbs the solace of our spiritual certitude. When we're in awe, life ceases to make sense, or at least to comply with the sense we've made of it so far. It doesn't make the kind of sense we thought it made before we were awed by something that seems beyond our understanding of what makes (or can make) sense. Awe results in a sense of fear and submission to things, events, people, and ideas that are experienced as being much greater than the self, and that can make us feel wonderful or terrible, or even both ways at the same time.<br><br>Choosing a life full of awe means that we are frequently anxious and uncertain and are never self-confident, because awe is the ultimate 'ism' breaker. Being in the kind of awe you will be reading about upsets any firm conviction we may hold&#x2015;that our personal version of monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, agnosticism, or atheism is the one and only right belief. Because it so suddenly puts an end to our sense of self&#x2015;and offers only mystery rather than answers, and a need to know more rather than a sense that we finally know it all&#x2015;awe is more like feeling repeatedly 'dead again' than the experience of being 'born again' (comfortably and safely converted to the certainty of having finally found the answer).<br><br>If you choose a life of awe, you will surrender the solace of certitude. You will live with more 'open-ture' than closure and, unless you can learn to find a strange, exciting comfort in being presented with and grappling with the tremendous mysteries life offers, you will seldom feel calm or at ease for very long. Awe offers far more stress and aggravation than comfort or relief, more self-doubt and agitation than assured self-confidence, and often more contemplative sadness than relieved joy. You might not end up having faith in anything other than the fact that life and the universe are not only beyond what you even imagined, but also transcend what anyone can or will ever be able to imagine. One woman from my Study of the Awe Inspired (SAI) described her awe response by saying, 'When I was in awe, I felt like I had suddenly discovered the secret of life, but I didn't know what it was. I just suddenly felt that there was this immense, scary, wonderfully overwhelming secret that made me feel afraid, sad, and strangely invigorated all at the same time. I don't think I've ever felt more messed up or more alive in my whole life.' <br><br>Another person I interviewed in SAI expressed her experience of awe by saying, 'When you have a lot of awe in your life, I mean the real deep kind of life-altering awe that makes you rethink everything, you're not born again. It's more like you keep dying again and again, until there's almost no more you. You're not 'born again' in any single religious sense because you don't end up converted or suddenly finding one answer or one idea that you have unshakable faith in. I guess the faith you do end up with, after you've thought a lot about whatever awed you, is a faith in the fact that there is an endless mystery of life that we're privileged to have the chance to grapple with, and that's a very big and fascinating thing to have faith in&#x2015;that's there's more than we do or can know. I agree now with Helen Keller when she said that life is a daring adventure or it is nothing at all.'<br><br>An Incredible Journey<br>Awe is experienced as the sudden awareness that life is, as the famous biologist J. B. S. Haldane put it in his essay 'Possible Worlds,' 'not only queerer than we suppose [which relates to a facinas, or fascinating life] but queerer than we can suppose [which relates to mysterium tremendium, or a tremendously mysterious life].'1 When we're in awe, Hamlet's challenge to Horatio that there are more things in heaven and earth than his philosophy could dream is experienced as is the even more disarming sense that there may be no philosophy sufficient to create a dream bizarre or outlandish enough to incorporate whatever it was that inspired our awe. Awe renders us dumbstruck, and it's up to us whether we want to take it from there and start thinking deeper and differently about life or experience a brief spiritual buzz that leaves our life's explanatory system unperturbed.<br><br>Awe can make us feel strange, because it's the emotion we feel when we're most in touch with the unfathomable eeriness that is the universe we live in. It wakes us from the languishing sleeplike state we've fallen into that results in taking so much of life for granted. If we think long and hard enough about whatever inspired it, awe can turn things we've gotten used to into revelations that make us wonder how we could have ever taken them for granted. Awe can turn what we seldom allow ourselves to pay attention to into astonishing new questions about our place in the universe&#x2015;questions that can take considerable mental effort to keep ignoring. But if you're the kind of person who's looking for answers, the choice of an awe-filled life isn't for you.<br><br>If you take a few moments to reflect on the following facts&#x2015;even though a very narrow band of imagination and understanding limits humans to sensing such a very small part of the world around us&#x2015;you might experience the blend of unbounded delight, humbling dread, and excited incredulousness that characterizes the awe response. It's difficult to imagine a race of beings taking the following facts for granted and considering them ordinary, but they describe how we're all traveling every second of our life: We �seldom think about it (our senses are so limited that we don't feel it, and our narrow band of belief seldom allows us to accept it), but we're all riding around together on one of the universe's billion fragile, cracking, exploding rocks, on which even our existence is a statistical fluke beyond one in billions. Sucked to our gas-covered rock by an invisible force, we're being spun around at 17 miles per second while at the same time whizzing at 19 miles per second around a nuclear exploding fireball that, even though it's 90 million miles away, holds our rock in its orbit with its invisible force, and, if our rock got too close, could cook us all in a nanosecond.<br><br>If thinking about those numbers isn't enough to tease at least a little awe out of you, consider these additional facts: The rock spinning us around, the fireball that keeps life on our rock alive, and the entire solar system that contains these speeding objects are also spinning together at 140 miles per second as one huge mass. This mass is spinning around the center of a galaxy called the Milky Way, and even at this unfathomable speed, this galaxy is so vast in size that it still takes about 200 million years for the rock and its fireball to complete one orbit around it.<br><br>If you've chosen the easier, busier, interesting, less mentally bothersome life over the harder, awesome kind that gets you more easily and deeply personally involved in tremendous mysteries suggested by those numbers, you may have already thought, 'Wow, that's kind of interesting,' and like a distracted business traveler on a jet plane, sat back and ignored how fast you are traveling, dismissed the perils of such a warp-speed trip, and preferred not to contemplate why or how this galactic race is happening in the first place. On the other hand, if you tend to have a lower awe threshold and are in the midst of the difficult mysterious life that comes with it, you may not only be thinking about what these numbers mean, but also even trying to feel the speed they describe.<br><br>If I still haven't gotten you to reflect on the fact of just how fast you're going and the paradox that you could be going so unbelievably fast and still feel that you're sitting perfectly still reading this book, maybe just a few more facts will engage your awe response. The Earth, Sun, and Milky Way are also speeding through the nothingness of space at 25 miles per hour, and, together with a few other neighboring galactic systems, this entire cosmic collection itself is also hurtling at 375 miles per second toward some of the other 100 billion-plus galaxies that are also spinning and whizzing around.<br>If thinking about all this for even a minute still doesn't boggle your mind to be awed enough to want to think about what this all means, consider that all of this speed is ultimately generated by the influence of invisible stuff called dark matter. That's a phrase similar to the old term terra incognita used by ancient cartographers, who were also in awe of the world they were trying to represent but couldn't find the words to describe undocumented mysterious territories.<br><br>Dark matter is something we can't see, but scientists have proven it has to be there because, whatever it is, its ghostly presence and energy keep pulling and tugging on the galaxies and the small amount of matter we can see, like the rock we're riding on. In fact astrophysicists tell us that the matter we see makes up only 4 percent of the universe, and based on what you are about to read about our awe response, that might serve as a reasonable estimate of about how much of our life we allow ourselves to be in awe of.<br>Because awe is so mind-boggling and perturbing to our mental and emotional status quo, you may have already said to yourself by now, 'Enough already! I get the point.' But do you? You will read in the following pages that awe can be so powerfully disruptive to our thinking that it tires it out, and we want to quickly try to get past it and move on. I encourage you not to bail out and instead to keep reflecting about the fantastic voyage you're on.<br><br>The harder life, one characterized by frequently being in awe and not being frightened by the time-consuming and often upsetting contemplation and reflection that awe offers, is the most fully lived life of all. But the choice is yours. You could decide to just be inspired for a few moments by the wonderfully puzzling events that happen in life, and then return quickly back to a more comfortable daily routine. Just as we're often told to 'keep busy' or 'keep going' or even take medication to numb our feelings to get us through our grief and despair, we can choose to be awed and let the terrible things pass or explain them away with old ideas seldom challenged or indoctrinated in us during childhood. The current incidence of languishing&#x2015;the psychological diagnosis for mistaking an intensely busy life for a meaningfully connected one&#x2015;is related to diminishing awe to a brief high that has little lasting impact on our lives.<br><br>Consider the fact that, in addition to the 22 percent of the universe made up of the mysterious dark matter, the rest of whatever 'is' in the universe is an even stranger something called dark energy. No one can see it, but it's pushing everything away from everything else. It makes up the remaining 74 percent of the universe and gives off a repulsive invisible energy totally resistant to gravity and that is causing the vast nothingness in which all the travel described in this chapter is taking place to constantly expand.<br><br>It seems worthy of our attention to reflect on the idea that nothingness can keep expanding as the after-effect of an as-yet-unexplained, sudden 'big bang' that took place 13 billion years ago, when time is assumed to have begun. I haven't had enough time yet to try to figure out where time was before it began, but some scientists now suggest that the nothingness of space may be breathing in a 20-billion-year cycle of an exhale-like, post-bang expansion, followed eventually by a reactive contraction in a big-crunch cosmic inhale, and so on and so on for infinity&#x2015;whatever that is.<br><br>You're probably suffering from severe awe fatigue by now, because the brain just doesn't want to deal with all this information and is more interested in its usual fixation on the four f's of fighting, fleeing, feeding, or fornicating. That's because we've allowed our awe response to atrophy from disuse. The easy life choosers might call the facts you've just read 'fascinating' or even say they knew them already&#x2015;and so what? But choosers of a difficult life who are open to awe's challenges are willing to go the next step to contemplating the tremendous mystery they represent. <br><br>A Debt to the Unborn<br>Awe is an overwhelming and bewildering sense of connection with a startling universe that is usually far beyond the narrow band of our consciousness. For many of us, a little awe once in a while in the form of brief, attentive fascination is enough, and the time and effort of reflective awe and all the mental and emotional upheaval it causes isn't something we want or have time for in our daily lives. Our awe response is made even more intense and bothersome because it comes with the frightening, increased awareness o...</p></p><h2>The Antagonists</h2><p>This is a great book well written and well researched even if it&#39;s just fiction.

Hoke: Lee&#39;s Modest Warrior</h2><p>Neglected by modern historians, Robert F. Hoke was a towering figure in his time. Mustered into Confederate service as a second lieutenant in April 1861, he was a major within five months, a lieutenant colonel within nine months, a colonel within sixteen months, a brigadier general within two years, and a major general within three years-becoming, at age twenty-six, the youngest Southern officer of that rank in the Civil War. <p> Of the 125,000 men his state contributed to the Confederate cause, it was Hoke who was called "the North Carolina Lee" and "the most distinguished soldier in North Carolina." In a face-to-face meeting after the war, U. S. Grant admitted that Hoke had administered "the worst drubbing I ever got," at Cold Harbor. </p><p> He fought in nearly every significant battle in the Eastern theater-Gaines' Mill, Malvern Hill, Second Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Plymouth, Petersburg, Richmond, Cold Harbor, Fort Fisher, Bentonville. He witnessed the first Confederate casualty at Bethel and provided the rear guard as Joseph E. Johnston met Sherman at Bennett Farm to arrange the surrender. </p><p> Back home, Hoke hitched his war-horse to a plow and quietly set about rebuilding the South, a cause that later inspired him to leadership positions in industry. A private man, he declined every major honor offered him by North Carolinians, including the governorship. He rarely spoke about the war-especially about his most notorious claim to fame, the still-disputed rumor that he was picked as Lee's successor should anything ever happen to the commander of the Army of Northern Virginia. </p><p> The personification of reserve, Hoke was once described thus: "Get you a hero, and I give you General Robert F. Hoke...as an ideal in peace and war."</p></p><p>Like Hoke, Daniel W. Barefoot&#39;s roots are in Lincoln County, North Carolina. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a graduate of the University of North Carolina School of Law, Barefoot now serves his state&#39;s 44th District in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He is the author of four volumes in the Touring the Backroads (tm) series.A biography that stresses its subject's modesty may be implying that he or she has a good deal to be modest about. Perhaps it was his modesty that made Robert F. Hoke (1837-1912) the last major Confederate general to warrant a full-length biography, but the fact is that Hoke established himself as one of the finest subordinate commanders in the Confederacy's eastern theater. Though not a professional soldier--he'd managed his family's manufacturing businesses before the war--Hoke served admirably with the Army of Northern Virginia as a regimental and brigade commander. Transferred to his home state of North Carolina after Gettysburg, he mounted a series of small but successful operations against Union forces. When he returned to Virginia in 1864 as a division commander, he came into his own, handling his command with skill and success in the siege of Petersburg. In the war's last months, Hoke made a final stand against Sherman's army. Barefoot's (Turning the Backwoods of North Carolina's Lower Coast) account of this latter campaign is among the best from a Confederate perspective. His seemingly almost uncritical admiration for Hoke, however, leads him to exaggerate both the general's importance and his talents. Nevertheless, Barefoot establishes Hoke as a general who improved with increased responsibilities, even in desperate circumstances. This quality, unusual in any war, justifies this near-hagiographic but exhaustively researched and informative study.

The bride was twenty-one and a half years old, her groom a few months short of forty-two. Apart from their substantial age difference, it seems to have been the very disparity of their intellectual and social backgrounds that drew them together. Mahler was attracted to Alma by her beauty, her alert mind and emotional intensity. Though aware that he possessed by far the broader outlook, he trusted in Alma's ability and willingness to learn from him."&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>"Once the stiffness of unfamiliarity has been softened by a few months of marriage, Mahler's style of correspondence with Alma is generally simple, direct, and astonishingly down-to-earth. In a manner akin to that of his musical style, he spikes his language with witticisms and double-entendres, colloquialisms and quotations from librettos and classical works of literature."&#x2015;from the Preface</p><p>This profusely illustrated collection of Gustav Mahler's letters to his wife Alma is more comprehensive than any previous edition; it contains 350 letters, 188 of them until now unpublished. Since 1995, when the German edition of this book was first published, two events have served to expand its horizons: the publication in 1997 of the complete text of Alma's early diaries, dating from January 1898 to March 1902, and the publication in 2003 of a catalogue of all Mahler letters acquired from the Moldenhauer Archives. With the aid of this new material, the editors were also able to revise the dates assigned to many of the letters. Commentaries and annotations throughout the book have been corrected and expanded annotations included. The editors' introduction provides a biographical context for the correspondence that follows.</p></p><p><p>Henry-Louis de La Grange is President of the Gustav Mahler Musical Library, Paris, and the author of a four-volume biography of Mahler. G�nther Weiss has published books and essays on, among others, Bart�k, Pfitzner, Reger, and Strauss. Knud Martner, a Danish music researcher, is the editor of Selected Letters of Gustav Mahler. Antony Beaumont is the author of Zemlinsky and coeditor with Susanne Rode-Breymann and translator of Alma Mahler-Werfel's Diaries 1898-1902 (both from Cornell).</p><p>"Gustav Mahler's letters to his wife have two distinct kinds of interest: as evidence in the story of a difficult and often unhappy marriage, and as a detailed, hour-by-hour account of the professional life of a great musician.... Mahler wrote nothing but music and letters: no essay, memoir, treatise or manifesto. From the music itself we can deduce much about his feelings for Beethoven or Wagner or Bach; but the letters, and the memoirs of others, are all we have to turn to for his explicit opinions on music.... The material in this book gives a large and deep picture of Mahler's personality. Just as his music is marked by shifts of register and scale, so his letters to Alma are engagingly many-voiced.... The fervent letters of the last year, many of them containing poems, are a record of the emotional distress bordering on madness that led Mahler to his consultation with Freud in August 1910. They are almost too painful and private to read."</p> (Alan Hollinghurst, The Guardian, October 30, 2004)<br><br><p>"The Mahler literature is huge, and many of Mahler's letters have already appeared in print. But what has come fully to light during the last decade adds greatly to our understanding of Mahler and his marriage.... This book allows us not only to fill in some gaps but to gain a vivid and telling portrayal of Mahler's personality in his voice."</p> (Hugh Wood, Times Literary Supplement, November 12, 2004)<br><br><p>"The letters... offer correctives to Alma's distortions and a fascinating glimpse into the grueling life of a renowned guest conductor, regularly subjected to overnight train rides, second-rate hotels, and exhausting rehearsals. The letters also reveal Mahler's complex character. He was impatient and arrogant but also generous, forgiving, and solicitous of his friends and colleagues."</p> (Tess Lewis, The Wall Street Journal, December 15, 2004)<br><br><p>"At first a little formal, Mahler's writing loosens up after a few months of marriage; soon he leavens his language with witticisms, clever quotes, double entendres, and slang. One hears the same tone in his later correspondence for example, as he writes in 1910 about his session with Freud. By contrast, Alma, always aware of posterity looking over her shoulder, seems eager to appear the consort of a demigod. Generously illustrated, well indexed, and conscientiously translated, this long-awaited volume will be devoured by Mahlerites and will be a valuable reader for others. Highly recommended."</p> (M. Meckna, Texas Christian University, Choice, April 2005)<br><br><p>"If you listen to Mahler's nine symphonies it is obvious the man was an artist in touch with oceans of raw emotion. It is enlightening, however, to square these tracts of musical genius with the fragile 'Gustl' revealed in these lettersTired, loving, ill, worried, romantic, neurotic, petty, angry, disenchanted: all the signs of a functional human being.... He is frequently witty, sometimes scathing, but more often sad, lonesome, and vulnerable.... This is a fine, if weighty and demanding, book that will help the casual reader more fully understand the personality of one of the great modern composers.... Devotees of the great man, however, will be equally saddened, moved, and transfixed by these letters, which at their most vivid are written with a quill dipped in the well of his agonized soul."</p> (Phil Miller, The Herald)<br><br><p>"Not unlike his grand and idiosyncratic musical oeuvre, Gustav Mahler's marriage to Alma Mahler straddled the border between the Romantic nineteenth and the Modern twentieth centuries.... Collectors of Mahleriana will find this expertly compiled volume indispensable. More than half of its 350 letters and postcards are published for the first time, and many of the old letters, which were once heavily emended by the distorting hands of Alma herself, are restored to their original form.... It's the novel-like intensity of the pair's complex and tempestuous love affair that will really broaden the audience for this book beyond its surefire appeal to students of modern art and feminism."</p> (Publishers Weekly, 13 December 2004)</p><h2>The Giraffe Who Cock-A-Doodle-Doo&#39;d</h2><p>When all of the animals in the jungle discover that their voices are all mixed up, hilarity ensues as Rooster roars like a lion, Elephant hisses like a snake, and Giraffe, who has never had a voice, makes the most wonderful sound in the world, in an entertaining pop-up book.</p><p>Join In the Fun!A rooster's roar sparks a cacophony of unexpected sounds in The Giraffe Who Cock-a-Doodle-Doo'd: A Pop-Up Book by Keith Faulkner, illus. by Jonathan Lambert.

But in 1970, everything changed.

Belli writes with both striking lyricism and candor about her personal and political lives: about her family, her children, the men in her life; about her poetry; about the dichotomies between her birth-right and the life she chose for herself; about the failures and triumphs of the Revolution; about her current life, divided between California (with her American husband and their children) and Nicaragua; and about her sustained and sustaining passion for her country and its people.</p><p>"This is the best autobiography I've read in years: a passionate, lyrical, tough-minded account of an extraordinary life in art, revolution and love.

This book is about American history, North and South; about power and the seeds of revolution; about one woman's life and choices entangled among many lives--and deaths--expended in the unkillable hope for human freedom and love. If her life seems romantic, she writes with the strength and clarity of a realist."<br>--Adrienne Rich, National Book Award winning poet<br><br>"Few writers have spoken so frankly about love, sex, childbearing and childrearing and the intimate connection of these issues with the wider political arena of war, revolution and the search for power.

She lives in New Hampshire, where she is at work on her next Stephanie Plum adventure.ONE<br><br>New Jersey was 40,000 feet below me, obscured by cloud cover. Heaven was above me, beyond the thin skin of the plane. And hell was sitting four rows back. Okay, maybe hell was too strong. Maybe it was just purgatory.<br><br>My name is Stephanie Plum, and I work as a bail bonds enforcer for Vincent Plum Bail Bonds in Trenton, New Jersey. I&#x2019;d recently inherited airline vouchers from a dead guy and used them to take a once in a lifetime Hawaiian vacation. Unfortunately the vacation didn&#x2019;t go as planned, and I&#x2019;d been forced to leave Hawaii ahead of schedule, like a thief sneaking off in the dead of night. I&#x2019;d abandoned two angry men in Honolulu, called my friend Lula, and asked her to pick me up at Newark Airport.<br><br>As if my life wasn&#x2019;t enough in the toilet, I was now on the plane home, seated four rows ahead of a guy who looked like Sasquatch and was snoring like a bear in a cave. Good thing I wasn&#x2019;t sitting next to him because I surely would have strangled him in his sleep by now. I was wearing airline-�distributed earphones pumped up to maximum volume, but they weren&#x2019;t helping. The snoring had started somewhere over Denver and got really ugly over Kansas City. After several loud passenger comments suggesting someone take the initiative and smother the guy, flight attendants confiscated all the pillows and began passing out free alcoholic beverages. Three-�quarters of the plane was now desperately drunk, and the remaining quarter was either under age or alternatively medicated. Two of the underage were screaming crying, and I was pretty sure the kid behind me had pooped in his pants.<br><br>I was among the drunk. I was wondering how I was going to walk off the plane and navigate the terminal with any sort of dignity, and I was hoping my ride was waiting for me.<br><br>Sasquatch gave an extra loud &#x201c;snork&#x201d; and I ground my teeth together. Just land this friggin&#x2019; plane, I thought. Land it in a cornfield, on a highway, in the ocean. Just get me out of here!<br><br>���<br><br>Lula pulled into my apartment building parking lot, and I thanked her for picking me up at the airport and taking me home.<br><br>&#x201c;No problemo,&#x201d; she said, dropping me at the back door to the lobby. &#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t nothing on television, and I&#x2019;m between honeys, so it wasn&#x2019;t like I was leaving anything good behind.&#x201d;<br><br>I waved her off, and trudged into my apartment building. I took the elevator to the second floor, dragged my luggage down the hall and into my apartment, and shuffled into my bedroom.<br><br>It was after midnight, and I was exhausted. My vacation in Hawaii had been unique, and the flight home had been hellish. Turbulance over the Pacific, a layover in L.A., and the snoring. I closed my eyes and tried to calm myself. I was back to work tomorrow, but for now I had to make a choice. I was completely out of clean clothes. That meant I could be a slut and sleep naked, or I could be a slob and sleep in what I was wearing.<br><br>Truth is, I&#x2019;m not entirely comfortable sleeping naked. I do it from time to time, but I worry that God might be watching or that my mother might find out, and I&#x2019;m pretty sure they both think nice girls should wear pajamas to bed.<br><br>In this case, being a slob required less effort and that&#x2019;s where I chose to go.<br><br>Unfortunately I was in the same wardrobe predicament when I dragged myself out of bed the next morning, so I emptied my suitcase into my laundry basket, grabbed the messenger bag that serves as a purse, and headed for my parents&#x2019; house. I could use my mom&#x2019;s washer and dryer, and I thought I had some emergency clothes left in their spare bedroom. Plus they&#x2019;d been babysitting my hamster Rex while I was away, and I wanted to retrieve him.<br><br>I live in a one bedroom, one bath apartment on the second floor of an aging three-�story brick-�faced apartment building located on the edge of Trenton. On a good traffic day, at four in the morning, it&#x2019;s a ten-�minute drive to my parent&#x2019;s house or the bonds office. All other times it&#x2019;s a crapshoot.<br><br>Grandma Mazur was at the front door when I pulled to the curb and parked. She&#x2019;s lived with my parents since Grandpa Mazur took the big escalator to the heavenly food court in the sky. Sometimes I think my father wouldn&#x2019;t mind seeing Grandma step onto that very same escalator, but I can&#x2019;t see it happening any time soon. Her steel grey hair was cut short and tightly curled on her head. Her nails matched her bright red lipstick. Her lavender and white running suit hung slack on her bony shoulders.<br><br>&#x201c;What a good surprise,&#x201d; Grandma said, opening the door to me. &#x201c;Welcome home. We&#x2019;re dying to hear all about the vacation with the hottie.&#x201d;<br><br>My parents&#x2019; home is a modest duplex, sharing a common wall with its mirror image. Mrs. Ciak lives in the other half. Her husband has passed on, and she spends her days baking coffee cake and watching television. The outside of her half is painted pale green, and the exterior of my parents&#x2019; house is mustard yellow and brown. It&#x2019;s not an attractive combination, but it feels comfortable to me since it&#x2019;s been that way for as long as I can remember. Each half of the house has a postage stamp front yard, a small covered front porch, a back stoop leading to a long narrow back yard, and a detached single car garage.<br><br>I lugged the laundry basket through the living room, and the dining room, to the kitchen where my mother was chopping vegetables.<br><br>&#x201c;Soup?&#x201d; I asked her.<br><br>&#x201c;Minestrone. Are you coming for dinner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t. Got plans.&#x201d;<br><br>My mother glanced at the laundry basket. &#x201c;I just put a load of sheets into the washer. If you leave that here I&#x2019;ll do it later for you. How was Hawaii? We didn&#x2019;t expect you home until tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hawaii was good, but the plane ride was long. Fortunately I sat next to a guy who got off when we stopped in LA, so I had more room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but you were also next to Mr. Tall, Dark, and Mysterious,&#x201d; Grandma said.<br><br>&#x201c;Not exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>This got both their attention.<br><br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d; Grandma asked.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s complicated. He didn&#x2019;t fly back with me.&#x201d;<br><br>Grandma stared at my left hand. &#x201c;You got a tan, except on your ring finger. It looks like you was wearing a ring when you got a tan, but you&#x2019;re not wearing it no more.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at my hand. Bummer. When I took the ring off, I hadn&#x2019;t noticed a tan line.<br><br>&#x201c;Now I know why you went to Hawaii,&#x201d; Grandma said. &#x201c;I bet you eloped! Of course being that you don&#x2019;t got the ring on any more would put a damper on the celebration.&#x201d;<br><br>I blew out a sigh and poured myself a cup of coffee. I took a sip, and my phone rang. I dug around in my bag, unable to find my phone in the jumble of stuff I&#x2019;d crammed in for the plane trip. I dumped it all out onto the little kitchen table and pawed through it. Granola bars, hairbrush, lip balm, hair scrunchies, note pad, wallet, socks, two magazines, a large yellow envelope, floss, mini flashlight, travel pack of tissues, three pens, and my phone.<br><br>The caller was Connie Rosolli, the bail bonds office manager. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re on your way to the office,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;because we have a situation here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of situation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A bad one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How bad? Can it wait twenty minutes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Twenty minutes sounds like a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>I disconnected and stood. &#x201c;Gotta go,&#x201d; I said to my mother and grandmother.<br><br>&#x201c;But you just got here,&#x201d; Grandma said. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t get to hear about the eloping.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t elope.&#x201d;<br><br>I returned everything to my messenger bag with the exception of the phone and the yellow envelope. I put the phone in an outside pocket, and I looked at the envelope. No writing on it. Sealed. I had no clue how it had gotten into my bag. I ripped it open and pulled a photograph out. It was an 8X10 glossy of a man. He was standing on a street corner, looking just past the photographer. He looked like he didn&#x2019;t know he was being photographed, like someone had happened along with their cell phone camera and snapped his picture. He was possibly mid-�thirties to early forties, and nice looking in a button-�down kind of way. Short brown hair. Fair-�skinned. Wearing a dark suit. I didn&#x2019;t recognize the street corner or the man. Somehow on the trip home I must have picked the envelope up by mistake&#x2014;�maybe when I stopped at the newsstand in the airport.</p><h2>The Crown of Columbus</h2><p>A very pregnant anthropologist finds the diary of Columbus in the basement of the Dartmouth library and travels to the Bahamas with her lover and son to find what the diary refers to as &#34;the greatest treasure of Europe.&#34; Reprint.</p><p><p>Louise Erdrich is the author of fifteen novels as well as volumes of poetry, children&#x2019;s books, short stories, and a memoir of early motherhood.

Fisher, Radford P.L., Va.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wheels of a Soul: Reincarnation and Kabbalah</h2><p>Wheels of a Soul is the book about reincarnation for 21st century readers. Here Rav Berg shows how an absolutely fundamental human precept -- that we have been here before, and that we will return here again until "we get it right" -- was for centuries either suppressed or ignored by religious and secular authorities. This is not just another New Age tract on "crossing over to the other side." This is the rediscovery of a principle that explains the reality we experience every day.<br>In a brilliant explanation of reincarnation for the modern reader, Rav Berg draws on basic Kabbalistic sources such as the Bible and the Zohar.<br><br>This is a revolutionary concept and Rav Berg presents it with exquisite clarity. In doing so, he answers questions that have compelled humankind for centuries: For what purpose are we in the world -- and how can we find the soul mate that will help us fulfill that purpose? Have we been here before -- and how can today's events illuminate past lifetimes? What is the true meaning of fate -- and how can we control fate through the power of our own free will?</p><p>Rav Berg was born August 20, 1927, in New York City. After many years of traditional religious study, he was ordained as a rabbi at Torah VaDaat. A businessman who wanted to make a difference in this world, he was always searching for his true path. Upon a chance meeting with Rav Yehuda Brandwein, Rav Berg knew he had found his teacher, and moved to Israel to study with Rav Brandwein at The Kabbalah Centre. After he returned to New York, Rav Berg maintained a written correspondence with Rav Brandwein who passed on his legacy as director of The Kabbalah Centre to Rav Berg. <p> Rav Berg made it his mission to continue editing, writing, printing, and distributing all that he learned from his teacher and began sharing the secrets of Kabbalah texts, which historically had been reserved for scholars. His book, Kabbalah for the Layman, was the revolutionary step that made Kabbalah accessible to every person. Rav Berg s other books include The Kabbalah Connection, Wheels of a Soul: Kabbalah and Reincarnation, To the Power of One, Energy of the Hebrew Letters, Immortality, Nano, The Kabbalah Method, Taming Chaos, and Education of a Kabbalist. </p><p> Together with his wife, Karen, Rav Berg opened the doors of The Kabbalah Centre to all who desire to learn this universal wisdom. Following Rav Berg's passing in September 2013, Karen Berg, the spiritual leader of The Kabbalah Centre, continues their work and vision with their son and co-director, Michael Berg.</p></p><h2>Godless: The Church of Liberalism</h2><p>"If a martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation's official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law.<br><br>Many Americans are outraged by liberal hostility to traditional religion. But as Ann Coulter reveals in this, her most explosive book yet, to focus solely on the Left's attacks on our Judeo-Christian tradition is to miss a larger point: liberalism <i>is</i> a religion&#x2014;a godless one.<br><br>And it is now entrenched as the state religion of this county.<br><br>Though liberalism rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, it bears all the attributes of a religion. In <i>Godless</i>, Coulter throws open the doors of the Church of Liberalism, showing us its sacraments (abortion), its holy writ (<i>Roe v. Wade</i>), its martyrs (from Soviet spy Alger Hiss to cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal), its clergy (public school teachers), its churches (government schools, where prayer is prohibited but condoms are free), its doctrine of infallibility (as manifest in the "absolute moral authority" of spokesmen from Cindy Sheehan to Max Cleland), and its cosmology (in which mankind is an inconsequential accident).<br><br>Then, of course, there's the liberal creation myth: Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.<br><br>For liberals, evolution is the touchstone that separates the enlightened from the benighted. But Coulter neatly reverses the pretense that liberals are rationalists guided by the ideals of free inquiry and the scientific method. She exposes the essential truth about Darwinian evolution that liberals refuse to confront: <i>it is bogus science</i>.<br><br>Writing with a keen appreciation for genuine science, Coulter reveals that the so-called gaps in the theory of evolution are all there is&#x2014;Darwinism is nothing but a gap. After 150 years of dedicated searching into the fossil record, evolution's proponents have failed utterly to substantiate its claims. And a long line of supposed evidence, from the infamous Piltdown Man to the "evolving" peppered moths of England, has been exposed as hoaxes. Still, liberals treat those who question evolution as religious heretics and prohibit students from hearing about real science when it contradicts Darwinism. And these are the people who say they want to keep faith out of the classroom?<br><br>Liberals' absolute devotion to Darwinism, Coulter shows, has nothing to do with evolution's scientific validity and everything to do with its refusal to admit the possibility of God as a guiding force. They will brook no challenges to the official religion.<br><br>Fearlessly confronting the high priests of the Church of Liberalism and ringing with Coulter's razor-sharp wit, <i>Godless</i> is the most important and riveting book yet from one of today's most lively and impassioned conservative voices.<br>"Liberals love to boast that they are not 'religious,' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as 'religion.'" <b>&#x2014;From Godless</b></p><p>Ann Coulter is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)</i>, <i>Treason, Slander, and High Crimes</i> and <i>Misdemeanors</i>.Chapter 1: On the Seventh Day, God Rested and Liberals Schemed<br><br>Liberals love to boast that they are not &#x201c;religious,&#x201d; which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion. Of course liberalism is a religion. It has its own cosmology, its own miracles, its own beliefs in the supernatural, its own churches, its own high priests, its own saints, its own total worldview, and its own explanation of the existence of the universe. In other words, liberalism contains all the attributes of what is generally known as &#x201c;religion.&#x201d; <br><br>Under the guise of not favoring religion, liberals favor one cosmology over another and demand total indoctrination into theirs. The state religion of liberalism demands obeisance (to the National Organization for Women), tithing (to teachers&#x2019; unions), reverence (for abortion), and formulaic imprecations (&#x201c;Bush lied, kids died!&#x201d; &#x201c;Keep your laws off my body!&#x201d; &#x201c;Arms for hostages!&#x201d;). Everyone is taxed to support indoctrination into the state religion through the public schools, where innocent children are taught a specific belief system, rather than, say, math. <br><br>Liberal doctrines are less scientifically provable than the story of Noah&#x2019;s ark, but their belief system is taught as fact in government schools, while the Biblical belief system is banned from government schools by law. As a matter of faith, liberals believe: Darwinism is a fact, people are born gay, child-molesters can be rehabilitated, recycling is a virtue, and chastity is not. If people are born gay, why hasn&#x2019;t Darwinism weeded out people who don&#x2019;t reproduce? (For that, we need a theory of survival of the most fabulous.) And if gays can&#x2019;t change, why do liberals think child-molesters can? Pedophilia is a sexual preference. If they&#x2019;re born that way, instead of rehabilitation, how about keeping them locked up? Why must children be taught that recycling is the only answer? Why aren&#x2019;t we teaching children &#x201c;safe littering&#x201d;? <br><br>We aren&#x2019;t allowed to ask. Believers in the liberal faith might turn violent&#x2014;much like the practitioners of Islam, the Religion of Peace, who ransacked Danish embassies worldwide because a Danish newspaper published cartoons of Mohammed. This is something else that can&#x2019;t be taught in government schools: Muslims&#x2019; predilection for violence. On the first anniversary of the 9/11 attack, the National Education Association&#x2019;s instruction materials exhorted teachers, &#x201c;Do not suggest that any group is responsible&#x201d; for the attack of 9/11. <br><br>If a Martian landed in America and set out to determine the nation&#x2019;s official state religion, he would have to conclude it is liberalism, while Christianity and Judaism are prohibited by law. And not just in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where it&#x2019;s actually on the books, but throughout the land. This is a country in which taxpayers are forced to subsidize &#x201c;artistic&#x201d; exhibits of aborted fetuses, crucifixes in urine, and gay pornography. Meanwhile, it&#x2019;s unconstitutional to display a Nativity scene at Christmas or the Ten Commandments on government property if the purpose is to promote monotheistic religion. <br><br>Nearly half the members of the Supreme Court&#x2014;the ones generally known as &#x201c;liberals&#x201d;&#x2014;are itching to ban the references to God on our coins and in the Pledge of Allegiance. They resisted in 2004 on procedural grounds only because it was an election year. The absence of a divinity makes liberals&#x2019; belief system no less religious. Liberals define religion as only those belief systems that subscribe to the notion of a divine being in order to dismiss other religions as mere religion and theirs as something greater. Shintoism and Buddhism have no Creator God either, and they are considered religions. Curiously, those are two of the most popular religions among leftists&#x2014;at least until 9/11, when Islam became all the rage. <br><br>Liberalism is a comprehensive belief system denying the Christian belief in man&#x2019;s immortal soul. Their religion holds that there is nothing sacred about human consciousness. It&#x2019;s just an accident no more significant than our possession of opposable thumbs. They deny what we know about ourselves: that we are moral beings in God&#x2019;s image. Without this fundamental understanding of man&#x2019;s place in the world, we risk being lured into misguided pursuits, including bestiality, slavery, and PETA membership. Liberals swoon in pagan admiration of Mother Earth, mystified and overawed by her power. They deny the Biblical idea of dominion and progress, the most ringing affirmation of which is the United States of America. Although they are Druids, liberals masquerade as rationalists, adopting a sneering tone of scientific sophistication, which is a little like being condescended to by a tarot card reader. <br><br>Liberals hate science and react badly to it. They will literally run from the room, lightheaded and nauseated, when told of data that might suggest that the sexes have different abilities in math and science. They repudiate science when it contradicts their pagan beliefs&#x2014;that the AIDS virus doesn&#x2019;t discriminate, that there is no such thing as IQ, that nuclear power is dangerous and scary, or that breast implants cause disease. Liberals use the word science exactly as they use the word <i>constitutional</i>. <br><br>Both words are nothing more or less than a general statement of liberal approval, having nothing to do with either science or the Constitution. (Thus, for example, the following sentence makes sense to liberals: <i>President Clinton saved the Constitution by repeatedly ejaculating on a fat Jewish girl in the Oval Office</i>.) The core of the Judeo-Christian tradition says that we are utterly and distinctly apart from other species. We have dominion over the plants and the animals on Earth. God gave it to us, it&#x2019;s ours&#x2014;as stated succinctly in the book of Genesis. Liberals would sooner trust the stewardship of the Earth to Shetland ponies and dung beetles. All their pseudoscience supports an alternative religion that says we are an insignificant part of nature. <br><br>Environmentalists want mass infanticide, zero population growth, reduced standards of living, and vegetarianism. The core of environmentalism is that they hate mankind. Everything liberals believe is in elegant opposition to basic Biblical precepts. <br><br>- Our religion says that human progress proceeds from the spark of divinity in the human soul; their religion holds that human progress is achieved through sex and death. <br><br>- We believe in invention and creation; they catalogue with stupefaction the current state of our diminishing resources and tell us to stop consuming. <br><br>- We say humans stand apart from the world and our charge is Planet Earth; they say we are part of the world, and our hubristic use of nature is sinful. <br><br>- We say humans are in God&#x2019;s image; they say we are no different morally from the apes. <br><br>- We believe in populating the Earth until there&#x2019;s standing room only and then colonizing Mars; they believe humans are in the twilight of their existence. <br><br>Our book is Genesis. Their book is Rachel Carson&#x2019;s <i>Silent Spring</i>, the original environmental hoax. Carson brainwashed an entire generation into imagining a world without birds, killed by DDT. Because of liberals&#x2019; druidical religious beliefs, they won&#x2019;t allow us to save Africans dying in droves of malaria with DDT because DDT might hurt the birds. A few years after oil drilling began in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, a saboteur set off an explosion blowing a hole in the pipeline and releasing an estimated 550,000 gallons of oil. It was one of the most devastating environmental disasters in recent history. Six weeks later, all the birds were back. Birds are like rats&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t get rid of them if you tried. <br><br>The various weeds and vermin liberals are always trying to save are no more distinguishable than individual styles of rap music. The massive Dickey-Lincoln Dam, a $227 million hydroelectric project proposed on upper St. John River in Maine, was halted by the discovery of the Furbish lousewort, a plant previously believed to be extinct. Liberals didn&#x2019;t even know this plant still existed, but suddenly they were seized with affection for it. They had been missing it all that time! (Granted, the rediscovery of the Furbish lousewort has improved the lives of every man, woman, and child in America in ways too numerous to count, but even so . . . ) Liberals are more upset when a tree is chopped down than when a child is aborted. Even if one rates an unborn child less than a full-blown person, doesn&#x2019;t the unborn child rate slightly higher than vegetation? Liberals are constantly warning us that man is overloading the environment to the detriment of the plants. Howard Dean left the Episcopal Church&#x2014;which is barely even a church&#x2014;because his church, in Montpelier, Vermont, would not cede land for a bike path. Environmentally friendly exercise was more important than tending to the human soul. <br><br>That&#x2019;s all you need to know about the Democrats. <br><br>Blessed be the peacemakers who create a diverse, nonsexist working environment in paperless offices. Suspiciously, the Democrats&#x2019; idea of an energy policy never involves the creation of new energy. They want solar power, wind power, barley power. How about creating a new source of energy? Nuclear reactors do that with no risk of funding Arab terrorists or&#x2014;more repellent to liberals&#x2014;Big Oil Companies. But in a spasm of left-wing insanity in the seventies, nuclear power was curtailed in this country. <br><br>Japan has nuclear power, France has nuclear power&#x2014;almost all modern countries have nuclear power. But we had Jane Fonda in the movie <i>The China Syndrome</i>. Liberals are very picky about their admiration for Western Europe. <br><br>Now it turns out even Chernobyl wasn&#x2019;t as bad as people thought. In a feat of Soviet engineering, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine exploded in 1986, sending chunks of the reactor core flying into nearby farms and igniting a fire at the reactor that burned for ten days. It was the worst nuclear disaster in history&#x2014;finally giving us a nuclear power plant that killed more people than died in Teddy Kennedy&#x2019;s car. But as the <i>New York Times</i> reported in September 2005, &#x201c;Nearly 20 years after the huge accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a new scientific report has found that its aftereffects on health and the environment have not proved as dire as scientists had predicted.&#x201d; Instead of tens of thousands of cancer deaths from acute radiation exposure, there were 4,000. Only 50 deaths were directly attributable to the explosion. There has been no increase in leukemia, birth defects, or fertility problems in the surrounding area. <br><br>And, I mention again, this was in the Soviet Union. Soviet engineers couldn&#x2019;t make Jell-O. They&#x2019;d show up at the World&#x2019;s Fair and stare at a flush toilet like it was a rocket ship. They turned half of Germany into an inefficient manufacturing center. Do you know how hard that is? It&#x2019;s like botching a train wreck. Of course the Soviets screwed up nuclear power! Instead of taking the environmentalist hamstrings off the muscular American economy&#x2014;so we can split atoms, drill, mine, and strip&#x2014;the Democrats want to preside over our state-managed descent into hell. <br><br>Liberals want us to live like Swedes, with their genial, mediocre lives, ratcheting back our expectations, practicing fuel austerity, and sitting by the fire in a cardigan sweater like Jimmy Carter. If one posits that we have a fixed amount of energy and have to start rationing it, then we are dying as a species. The theory of vegetarianism is that Americans consume &#x201c;too much&#x201d; energy. It takes a lot of energy to grow corn to feed animals to feed us&#x2014;so why don&#x2019;t we become a bunch of grazing farmyard animals ourselves? We can eat grass and share our energy with the birds! <br><br>Environmentalists&#x2019; energy plan is the repudiation of America and Christian destiny, which is Jet Skis, steak on the electric grill, hot showers, and night skiing. Perennially irritating to environmentalists is mankind&#x2019;s single greatest invention: the flush toilet. You knew it had to happen. Apostles of &#x201c;dry toilets&#x201d; insist that we &#x201c;have to get beyond flush-and forget technology,&#x201d; as it was put by Sim Van der Ryn, founder of the Ecological Design Institute. Flush-and-forget abortions are one thing, but this is solid human waste we&#x2019;re talking about! Apparently, we need to spend more time thinking about our excrement. Van der Ryn explained that the goal was &#x201c;to deal with one&#x2019;s own waste as close to the source as possible&#x201d;&#x2014;precisely the opposite of what humans have wanted to do with their excrement since the beginning of time. <br><br>Nonflush toilets were first introduced in America&#x2014;well, originally by the Indians&#x2014;but then again in the sixties by a Rockefeller scion who promoted a &#x201c;dry toilet&#x201d; called the Clivus Multrum. They pop up again every few years but, oddly enough, never seem to catch on. Dry toilets are like the metric system of human waste disposal. <br><br>In 1995, the <i>New York Times</i> was enthusiastically reporting on the move away from mankind&#x2019;s greatest invention by homeowners &#x201c;fed up with overdevelopment, contaminated ground water, and overflowing septic tanks&#x201d;&#x2014;but evidently not fed up with living on top of their own excrement. These homeowners were creating environmentally friendly ways to keep their excrement close to them. They created miniature wetlands in their backyards, solar toilets, or composting toilets. Only recently have advocates of nonflush toilets begun to recognize their product&#x2019;s central shortcoming, which is the natural human aversion to the &#x201c;routine emptying of excrement from the toilets.&#x201d; <br><br>Instead of the organic method of living in your own excrement, most people prefer the inorganic method of flushing it away from themselves. Consequently, the federal government has done the next best thing for the official state religion, which is to make it a felony to replace a 1.3-gallon toilet bowl with an old-fashioned 7-gallon toilet bowl&#x2014;or as we call it, &#x201c;a working toilet.&#x201d; <br><br>The whole purpose of living in your own excrement is to save . . . water. Water. Liberals are worried we&#x2019;re going to run out of something that literally falls from the sky. Here&#x2019;s an idea: Just wait. It will rain. Every possible personal use of water combined&#x2014;steam baths, swimming pools, showers, toilets, and kitchen sinks&#x2014;amounts to less than 10 percent of all water usage. Agricultural use accounts for about 70 percent of water usage and industrial use more than 20 percent. But again in 2003, the Greens were calling flush toilets &#x201c;an environmental disaster.&#x201d; They want us to go to the bathroom outdoors because, you know, we&#x2019;re animals. <br><br><i>Question: Are liberals clueless about waste management?

It reveals his continuing efforts to avoid a war with England or France while using the threat of war to prevent European recognition of Confederate independence. Mahin covers Confederate efforts to obtain diplomatic recognition, the construction of warships for the Confederacy in Britain, the British role in the blockade-running operation, and the postwar &#34;Alabama claims&#34; against Britain. Mahin also provides the first full anlysis of U.S. and Confederate reactions to the French intervention in Mexico and to the efforts to establish an imperial government in Mexico.</p><p>DEAN B.

Most of them take as their starting point the options facing the wealthy and powerful nations of the world seeking to control an ever larger share of the world's resources. <b>Behind the Invasion of Iraq</b> is written from a different perspective, and one that makes possible a far more comprehensive point of view.</p> <p>Its authors, Research Unit for Political Economy, are rooted in the politics of a Third World country&#x2014;India&#x2014;which has long been on the receiving end of imperialist power. As a consequence, they have a more sober view of the workings of global power. In clear and accessible prose, weighing the evidence carefully and tracing events to their root causes, they move beyond moral outrage to a clear view of the process being set in motion by the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. They show that the invasion of Iraq is a desperate gamble by a section of the U.S. ruling elite to preserve their power, driven by the wish to stave off economic crisis through military means. Their efforts will not end with Iraq, but will require the recolonization of the middle East.</p> <p><b>Behind the Invasion of Iraq</b> exposes the idea that war will bring democracy to the Middle East as so much propaganda. In a context where so many rulers are themselves clients of the United States, the war is aimed not at the rulers but at the masses of ordinary people whose hostility to imperialism has not been broken even by corrupt and autocratic rulers.

Sands has been involved in many of the recent high profile cases in the World Court and elsewhere, including representing the interests of the British detainees at Guantánamo and the efforts to extradite Augusto Pinochet to Spain. He has written for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>The Washington Post</i>, taught at NYU and Boston College, and appears regularly on CNN and the BBC.Sands, a British international lawyer and law professor, delivers a cool, reasoned lashing to the Bush administration for leading&#x2014;and to Tony Blair for colluding with&#x2014;a "full-scale assault" on the international rule of law, in this richly detailed survey of modern international legal disputes. Since FDR and Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter after WWII, putting in place a rules-based system limiting the use of force, protecting human rights and promoting fair economic liberalization, the world has seen a transformation of international relations, Sands explains, most dramatically marked by Bush's decision to "go it alone." Tracking the current administration's "efforts to rewrite international law into irrelevance," Sands covers the Pinochet case, the creation of the International Criminal Court, U.S. abandonment of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the U.S.'s selectively multilateralist policy vis-�-vis global free trade, and the "disgraces" of Guant�namo, Iraq and Abu Ghraib. The author also presents a series of dense but lucidly written legal stories to illustrate how the Bush administration's unilateralism has had egregious consequences for 21st-century efforts to make the world safer, cleaner and more just. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Based on decades of scholarship, documentation newly available from the opening of Soviet archives, declassification of Western intelligence service records, as well as diaries and reports written in the camps, Cesarani provides a sweeping reappraisal that challenges accepted explanations for the anti-Jewish politics of Nazi Germany and the inevitability of the &#x201c;final solution.&#x201d; The persecution of the Jews, as Cesarani sees it, was not always the Nazis&#x2019; central preoccupation, nor was it inevitable. He shows how, in German-occupied countries, it unfolded erratically, often due to local initiatives. For Cesarani, war was critical to the Jewish fate. Military failure denied the Germans opportunities to expel Jews into a distant territory and created a crisis of resources that led to the starvation of the ghettos and intensified anti-Jewish measures. Looking at the historical record, he disputes the iconic role of railways and deportation trains. From prisoner diaries, he exposes the extent of sexual violence and abuse of Jewish women and follows the journey of some Jewish prisoners to displaced persons camps. David Cesarani&#x2019;s <i>Final Solution</i> is the new standard chronicle of the fate of a heroic people caught in the hell that was Hitler&#x2019;s Germany.</p><p><b>DAVID CESARANI, OBE, </b>was Research Professor in History at Royal Holloway, University of London and the award-winning author of <i>Becoming Eichmann</i> and <i>Major Farran's Hat</i>.

She is the anthologist of the highly acclaimed poetry book, Dancing Teepees : Poems of American Indian Youth, illustrated by Stephen Gammell. The mother of three grown children, Ms. Sneve works as a high school counselor and teaches English at Oglala Lakota College, Rapid City Extension.Grade 3-5-A stylistically superior book written in a clear expository manner and complemented by Himler's painterly illustrations. Sneve asserts that "Like the white men, they [the Seminole] had black slaves, but they treated their slaves with respect...The blacks had been trained in agriculture on white plantations, and this knowledge helped the Seminole farmers thrive." This seems to slight both the Africans and Indians' millenia of farming practices. On the whole, though, the text is good and covers the Seminole Wars; Osceola; and such aspects of life as clothing, children, the Green Corn Dance, and the Seminoles today. A map of current lands precedes the narrative, but there is no map of their historical territory or current population figures. Himler's illustrations are the book's high point. Although he has a tendency toward indistinct rendering of his subjects' facial features, his figures and landscapes are both aesthetically pleasing and pertinent to the discussion. Overall, this is an inviting and readable title, with plenty of information for reports.<br><i>M.

Mowat is dropped alone onto the frozen tundra, where he begins his mission to live among the howling wolf packs and study their waves. Contact with his quarry comes quickly, and Mowat discovers not a den of marauding killers but a courageous family of skillful providers and devoted protectors of their young. As Mowat comes closer to the wolf world, he comes to fear with them on onslaught of bounty hunters and government exterminators out to erase the noble wolf community from the Arctic. <i>Never Cry Wolf</i> is one of the brilliant narratives on the myth and magical world of wild wolves and man's true place among the creatures of nature. "We have doomed the wolf not for what it is, but for what we deliberately and mistakenly perceive it to be -- the mythological epitome of a savage, ruthless killer -- which is, in reality, no more than the reflected image of ourself." -- from the new preface to <i>Never Cry Wolf</i>.</p><p><b>Farley Mowat</b> was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1921, and grew up in Belleville, Trenton, Windsor, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Richmond Hill.

Nevertheless, there must be a beginning to any tale; and the story of my sojourn amongst the wolves begins properly in Granny&#x2019;s bathroom.<br><br>When I was five years old I had still not given any indication &#x2013; as most gifted children do well before that age &#x2013; of where my future lay. Perhaps because they were disappointed by my failure to declare myself, my parents took me to Oakville and abandoned me to the care of my grandparents while they went off on a holiday.<br><br>The Oakville house &#x2013; &#x201c;Greenhedges&#x201d; it was called &#x2013; was a singularly genteel establishment, and I did not feel at home there. My cousin, who was resident in Greenhedges and was some years older than myself, had already found his m�tier, which lay in the military field, and had amassed a formidable army of lead soldiers with which he was single-mindedly preparing himself to become a second Wellington. My loutish inability to play Napoleon exasperated him so much that he refused to have anything to do with me except under the most formal circumstances.<br><br>Grandmother, an aristocratic lady of Welsh descent who had never forgiven her husband for having been a retail hardware merchant, tolerated me but terrified me too. She terrified most people, including Grandfather, who had long since sought surcease in assumed deafness. He used to while away the days as calm and unruffled as Buddha, ensconced in a great leather chair and apparently oblivious to the storms which swirled through the corridors of Greenhedges. And yet I know for a fact that he could hear the word &#x201c;whiskey&#x201d; if it was whispered in a room three stories removed from where he sat.<br><br>Because there were no soulmates for me at Greenhedges, I took to roaming about by myself, resolutely eschewing the expenditure of energy on anything even remotely useful; and thereby, if anyone had had the sense to see it, giving a perfectly clear indication of the pattern of my future.<br><br>One hot summer day I was meandering aimlessly beside a little local creek when I came upon a stagnant pool. In the bottom, and only just covered with green scum, three catfish lay gasping out their lives. They interested me. I dragged them up on the bank with a stick and waited expectantly for them to die; but this they refused to do. Just when I was convinced that they were quite dead, they would open their broad ugly jaws and give another gasp. I was so impressed by their stubborn refusal to accept their fate that I found a tin can, put them in it along with some scum, and took them home.<br><br>I had begun to like them, in an abstract sort of way, and wished to know them better. But the problem of where to keep them while our acquaintanceship ripened was a major one. There were no washtubs in Greenhedges. There <i>was</i> a bathtub, but the stopper did not fit and consequently it would not hold water for more than a few minutes. By bedtime I had still not resolved the problem and, since I felt that even these doughty fish could hardly survive an entire night in the tin can, I was driven to the admittedly desperate expedient of finding temporary lodgings for them in the bowl of Granny&#x2019;s old-fashioned toilet.<br><br>I was too young at the time to appreciate the special problems which old age brings in its train. It was one of these problems which was directly responsible for the dramatic and unexpected encounter which took place between my grandmother and the catfish during the small hours of the ensuing night.<br><br>It was a traumatic experience for Granny, and for me, and probably for the catfish too. Throughout the rest of her life Granny refused to eat fish of any kind, and always carried a high-powered flashlight with her during her nocturnal peregrinations. I cannot be as certain about the effect on the catfish, for my unfeeling cousin &#x2013; once the hooferaw had died down a little &#x2013; callously flushed the toilet. As for myself, the effect was to engender in me a lasting affinity for the lesser beasts of the animal kingdom. In a word, the affair of the catfish marked the beginning of my career, first as a naturalist, and later as a biologist. I had started on my way to the wolf den.<br><br>My infatuation with the study of animate nature grew rapidly into a full-fledged love affair. I found that even the human beings with whom the study brought me into contact could be fascinating too. My first mentor was a middle-aged Scotsman who gained his livelihood delivering ice, but who was in fact an ardent amateur mammalogist. At a tender age he had developed mange, or leprosy, or some other such infantile disease, and had lost all his hair, never to recover it &#x2013; a tragedy which may have had a bearing on the fact that, when I knew him, he had already devoted fifteen years of his life to a study of the relationship between summer molt and incipient narcissism in pocket gophers. This man had become so intimate with gophers that he could charm them with sibilant whistles until they would emerge from their underground retreats and passively allow him to examine the hair on their backs.<br>Nor were the professional biologists with whom I later came into contact one whit less interesting. When I was eighteen I spent a summer doing field work in the company of another mammalogist, seventy years of age, who was replete with degrees and whose towering stature in the world of science had been earned largely by an exhaustive study of uterine scars in shrews. This man, a revered professor at a large American university, knew more about the uteri of shrews than any other man has ever known. Furthermore he could talk about his subject with real enthusiasm. Death will find me long before I tire of contemplating an evening spent in his company during which he enthralled a mixed audience consisting of a fur trader, a Cree Indian matron, and an Anglican missionary, with an hour-long monologue on sexual aberrations in female pygmy shrews. (The trader misconstrued the tenor of the discourse; but the missionary, inured by years of humorless dissertations, soon put him right.)<br>My early years as a naturalist were free and fascinating, but as I entered manhood and found that my avocation must now become my vocation, the walls began to close in. The happy days of the universal scholar who was able to take a keen interest in all phases of natural history were at an end, and I was forced to recognize the unpalatable necessity of specializing, if I was to succeed as a professional biologist. Nevertheless, as I began my academic training at the university, I found it difficult to choose the narrow path.<br><br>For a time I debated whether or not to follow the lead of a friend of mine who was specializing in scatology &#x2013; the study of the excretory droppings of animals &#x2013; and who later became a high-ranking scatologist with the United States Biological Survey. But although I found the subject mildly interesting, it failed to rouse my enthusiasm to the pitch where I could wish to make it my lifework. Besides, the field was overcrowded.<br><br>My personal predelictions lay towards studies of living animals in their own habitat. Being a literal fellow, I took the word <i>biology &#x2013; </i>which means the study of life &#x2013; at its face value. I was sorely puzzled by the paradox that many of my contemporaries tended to shy as far away from living things as they could get, and chose to restrict themselves instead to the aseptic atmosphere of laboratories where they used dead &#x2013; often very dead &#x2013; animal material as their subject matter. In fact, during my time at the university it was becoming unfashionable to have <i>anything</i> to do with animals, even dead ones. The new biologists were concentrating on statistical and analytical research, whereby the raw material of life became no more than fodder for the nourishment of calculating machines.<br><br>My inability to adjust to the new trends had an adverse effect upon my professional expectations. While my fellow students were already establishing themselves in various esoteric specialties, most of which they invented for themselves on the theory that if you are the <i>only</i> specialist in a given field you need fear no competition, I was still unable to deflect my interests from the general to the particular. As graduation approached I found that the majority of my contemporaries were assured of excellent research jobs while I seemed to have nothing particular to offer in the biological marketplace. It was, therefore, inevitable that I should end up working for the Government.<br><br>The die was cast one winter&#x2019;s day when I received a summons from the Dominion Wildlife Service informing me that I had been hired at the munificent salary of one hundred and twenty dollars a month, and that I &#x201c;would&#x201d; report to Ottawa at once.<br><br>I obeyed this peremptory order with hardly more than a twitch of subdued rebelliousness, for if I had learned anything during my years at the university it was that the scientific hierarchy requires a high standard of obedience, if not subservience, from its acolytes.<br><br>Two days later I arrived in the windswept, gray-souled capital of Canada and found my way into the dingy labyrinth which housed the Wildlife Service. Here I presented myself to the Chief Mammalogist, whom I had known as a school chum in more carefree days. But alas, he had now metamorphosed into a full-blown scientist, and was so shrouded in professional dignity that it was all I could do to refrain from making him a profound obeisance.<br><br>Through the next several days I was subjected to something called &#x201c;orientation&#x201d; &#x2013; a process which, so far as I could see, was designed to reduce me to a malleable state of hopeless depression. At any rate, the legions of Dantesque bureaucrats whom I visited in their gloomy, Formalin-smelling dens, where they spent interminable hours compiling dreary data or originating meaningless memos, did nothing to rouse in me much devotion to my new employment. The only thing I actually <i>learned</i> during this period was that, by comparison with the bureaucratic hierarchy in Ottawa, the scientific hierarchy was a brotherhood of anarchy.<br><br>This was driven home one memorable day when, having at last been certified as fit for inspection, I was paraded into the office of the Deputy Minister, where I so far forgot myself as to address him as &#x201c;Mister.&#x201d; My escort of the moment, all white-faced and trembling, immediately rushed me out of the Presence and took me by devious ways to the men&#x2019;s washroom. Having first knelt down and peered under the doors of all the cubicles to make absolutely certain we were alone and could not be overheard, he explained in an agonized whisper that I must never, on pain of banishment, address the Deputy as anything but &#x201c;Chief,&#x201d; or, barring that, by his Boer War title of &#x201c;Colonel.&#x201d;<br><br>Military titles were <i>de rigeur</i>. All memos were signed Captain-this or Lieutenant-that if they originated from the lower echelons; or Colonel-this and Brigadier-that if they came down from on high. Those members of the staff who had not had the opportunity to acquire even quasi-military status were reduced to the expedient of inventing suitable ranks &#x2013; field ranks if they were senior men, and subaltern ranks for the juniors. Not everyone took this matter with due solemnity, and I met one new employee in the fishery section who distinguished himself briefly by sending a memo up to the Chief signed &#x201c;J. Smith, Acting Lance-Corporal.&#x201d; A week later this foolhardy youth was on his way to the northernmost tip of Ellesmere Island, there to spend his exile living in an igloo while studying the life history of the nine-spined stickleback.<br>Levity was not looked upon with favor anywhere in those austere offices, as I discovered for myself while attending a conference concerning my first assignment.<br><br>A tentative list of the material requirements for this assignment lay on the conference table, surrounded by many grave countenances. It was a formidable document, made out in quintuplicate &#x2013; as was the official rule &#x2013; and imposingly headed:<br><br>DESIDERATA FOR THE LUPINE PROJECT<br><br>Having already been unnerved by the gravity of the gathering, I lost my head completely when the assembly began to consider the twelfth item listed in this horrendous document:<br><br><i>Paper, toilet, Government standard: 12 rolls</i>.<br>An austere suggestion by the representative of the Finance Department that, in the interest of economy, the quantity of this item might be reduced, providing the field party (which was me) exercised all due restraint, sent me into an hysterical spasm of giggling. I mastered myself almost instantly, but it was too late. The two most senior men, both &#x201c;majors,&#x201d; rose to their feet, bowed coldly, and left the room without a word.<br><br>The Ottawa ordeal drew toward its end; but the climax was still to come. One early spring morning I was called to the office of the senior officer who was my direct chief, for a final interview before departing &#x201c;into the field.&#x201d;<br><br>My chief sat behind a massive desk whose dusty surface was littered with yellowing groundhog skulls (he had been studying rates of tooth decay in groundhogs ever since he joined the Department in 1897). At his back hung the frowning, bearded portrait of an extinct mammalogist who glared balefully down upon me. The smell of Formalin swirled about like the fetid breath of an undertaker&#x2019;s back parlor.<br><br>After a long silence, during which he toyed portentously with some of his skulls, my chief began his briefing. There was a solemnity about the occasion which would have done justice to the briefing of a special agent about to be entrusted with the assassination of a Head of State.<br><br>&#x201c;As you are aware, Lieutenant Mowat,&#x201d; my chief began, &#x201c;the <i>Canis lupus</i> problem has become one of national importance. Within this past year alone this Department has received no less than thirty-seven memoranda from Members of the House of Commons, all expressing the deep concern of their constituents that we ought to do something about the wolf. Most of the complaints have come from such civic-minded and disinterested groups as various Fish and Game clubs, while members of the business community &#x2013; in particular the manufacturers of some well-known brands of ammunition &#x2013; have lent their weight to the support of these legitimate grievances of the voting public of this Great Dominion, because their grievance is the complaint that the wolves are killing all the deer, and more and more of our fellow citizens are coming back from more and more hunts with less and less deer.<br><br>&#x201c;As you may possibly have heard, my predecessor supplied the Minister with an explanation of this situation in which it was his contention that there were fewer deer because the hunters had increased to the point where they outnumbered the deer about five to one. The Minister, in all good faith, read this fallacious statement in the House of Commons, and he was promptly shouted down by Members howling &#x2018;Liar!&#x2019; and &#x2018;Wolf-lover!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x201c;Three days later my predecessor retired to civilian life, and the Minister issued a press statement: &#x2018;The Department of Mines and Resources is determined to do everything in its power to curb the carnage being wreaked upon the deer population by hordes of wolves. A full-scale investigation of this vital problem, employing the full resources of the Department, is to be launched at once. The people of this country can rest assured that the Government of which I have the honor to be a member will leave no stone unturned to put an end to this intolerable situation.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>At this ju...</p><h2>On a Pirate Ship (Picture Books)</h2><p>A pirate and his crew set sail in search of treasure, but they must first endure a storm and fight a battle.</p><p></p><h2>Waking Nightmare (Mindhunters)</h2><p>With a serial rapist loose on the streets of Savannah, hotshot detective Ryne Robel needs answers, not the psycho-babble head games of forensic profile Abbie Phillips.

To find the killer, Robel reluctantly teams up with elfin criminologist Abbie Phillips. As Abbie and Ryne begin to piece together the clues, crossed wires turn into sparks. Though the novel opens with a generic structure, the writing is vivid and strong. Brant does an excellent job of building the partnership and attraction between Abbie and Ryne, and clearly enjoys showing off their razzle-dazzle police procedural techniques and banter.

Following Dr. Breus s recipes for better sleep can help you shed pounds painlessly. Mehmet Oz, MD, host of The Dr. Oz Show</p><p>Michael Breus, PhD, is a clinical psychologist who is board certified in clinical sleep disorders. He is the sleep expert on WebMD and on <i>The Dr. Oz Show</i>.

She lives in Atlanta, GA.1 The Sleep/Weight Connection<br><br>If you're like most women with a few �ds to lose, you've probably tried just about everything to rid yourself of that unwanted I weight. Perhaps you've experimented with a low-carb or low-fat diet or an eating plan that severely restricts calories, or maybe you've amped up your fitness routine, and yet those unwanted �ds hang on stubbornly. But there's one thing I bet you haven't tried in your battle of the bulge, and that is getting more sleep.<br><br>Think about it. How incredible would it be if the only change you had to make to your routine in order to drop 5, 10, or even more �ds was to get an extra hour of sleep? No more cabbage soup. No high-fiber wafers or extra Spin classes--just 1 more hour of restorative, restful sleep each and every day. Who in the world (including your doctor, by the way) would object to that?<br><br>But can sleep possibly be an effective diet aid? Can something so benign, so sustainable--so inexpensive!--with absolutely no unwanted side effects possibly get you the results that all the deprivation diets and long hours at the gym have failed to achieve? The research is clear and conclusive: Giving your body the rest it needs will enable you to lose weight even if you do not alter your diet or fitness routine. Furthermore, no matter how conscientious you are about what you eat and how active you are, a poor sleep pattern is likely to torpedo your good intentions and allow those extra �ds to creep onto your body and stay there!<br><br>I wrote The Sleep Doctor's Diet Plan to help you understand your unique relationship with sleep and what good sleep can do to improve your weight, your health, and how you feel about yourself. I want you to learn ways to regain control in your nightly sleep battle or to simply make your good sleep even better so you can either achieve the healthy weight you want or prevent the gradual accumulation of fat around the waist that so inevitably seems to occur as we age.<br><br>Sleep Is the Missing Link<br><br>In my clinical practice, I treat hundreds of women who come to me with complaints of poor sleep and an inability to lose weight. Most women tell of having either difficulty sleeping (whether it's falling asleep or staying asleep) or poor-quality sleep.<br><br>My sleep patients also say, "You don't understand what I am going through, trying to lose weight. Nothing works," but I really do understand. As a clinical psychologist who is board certified in clinical sleep disorders, I have treated many women who have the same problem--an inability to sleep combined with an inability to make the scale budge, despite trying every diet--low carb, low fat, and low calorie.<br><br>The reality is that women face different situations in life that cause their weight gain--ranging from ongoing family or career stress to ignoring the importance of daily exercise to hormonal changes at midlife that pack on the �ds--and most will have a hard time reversing that weight gain. This can be frustrating, especially when you try to stick with a popular diet and exercise regimen that's "guaranteed" to bring success.<br><br>But I have discovered that there is a "missing link" in most trendy weight- loss diets and it has nothing to do with what you eat or how many miles you log on your treadmill each day. In fact, this missing link provides women of all ages with a tool for dealing with what the surgeon general calls "America's obesity crisis." That missing link is proper and adequate sleep.<br><br>After sorting through the ever-mounting stacks of scientific literature, I have identified a clear-cut connection between poor sleep and obesity. In a nutshell, both insufficient sleep and poor-quality sleep make your body want to store fat, not burn it! Moreover, I have discovered that the best way to decrease your weight is to increase good-quality sleep in conjunction with following a balanced weight-loss diet. And even without changing the food you eat or exercising vigorously, simply getting better sleep can help you lose weight or maintain a normal weight. In this book, I will teach you how to boost your metabolic rate, decrease your appetite, and lose weight simply by improving your sleep quality and quantity.<br><br>Here's why. During deep sleep, your brain secretes a large amount of growth hormone, which tells your body how to break down fat for fuel. If you don't allow your body to get enough deep sleep, there won't be enough growth hormone to break down the fat that results when you take in extra calories. Instead, your body takes a shortcut and packs the added fat away in your thighs, belly, or butt--wherever you tend to gain weight. In addition, poor sleep appears to increase your appetite. And what an appetite you will have: You'll crave sweets, carbs, and high-fat foods.<br><br>As a researcher and a practicing sleep doctor, I use both scientific data and information from my patients to help me develop therapies for the people who seek treatment at my sleep clinic. No matter how many diets my patients have tried (and failed at) in the past, I find that they won't lose the extra weight and keep it off until they relearn how to get better sleep.<br><br>I know what you're thinking: Between kids, career, and commitments, who really has time for more sleep? For most women, there's always one more thing to do--one more lunch to make, one more client to e-mail, one more problem to worry about. All too often, sleep becomes the last priority on your to-do list. But if sleep becomes a hit-or-miss proposition for you, it's more than likely that the eventual result will be a gradual-- potentially permanent--weight gain.<br><br>There is no doubt that consistently getting a good night's sleep is a familiar battle in our society today. Perhaps you know from experience how a lack of sleep can wreak havoc on your energy level and performance. The problem arises when you get inadequate sleep day after day. You will not only experience a lack of energy and an inability to focus during the day, but also start to notice that your waistband is snugger, your jeans feel tighter, and the number on the bathroom scale is inching higher. Believe me when I say that these occurrences are no coincidence! Recent research has found that people who sleep less have a slower metabolic rate (the speed at which your body burns calories and the rate that we all want to raise!). Metabolism is the body's process for turning calories into energy, and it varies at different sleep stages. For instance, REM is the sleep stage during which metabolism is the highest. If you get less sleep, you get less REM sleep, too. This sets the stage for eating the wrong foods, eating too much food, and eating at the wrong time of day (or night).<br><br>Good Sleep Is Essential--Every Night<br><br>You know that even occasional sleep problems make a normal day more stressful and less productive. That's because your body and mind need consistent, restful sleep to function optimally. Remember, sleep is not a luxury or a treat, like splurging on dessert. Sleep is a necessary physiological function that keeps you alive. Let's take a look at how missing just 1 night of shut-eye affects your looks, your mind, and your health.<br><br>. Your skin looks pasty, your eyes get puffy, and poor hydration makes your under-eye circles more pronounced. . Your prefrontal cortex shuts down. This is the part of your brain that controls logical reasoning and the "fight-or-flight" response. You instantly become a poor decision maker. As a result, your choices of foods lean toward comfort foods (i.e., high carbs and high fat) to increase your level of serotonin (the calming hormone), and you're apt to skip the gym because of fatigue. . Your insulin production increases and your body starts to store fat more easily. Over time, this can lead to serious illnesses such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. . You have problems completing tasks, whether simple or complex. . Your ability to speak and remember diminishes as your brain is depleted of its ability to consolidate memories. . You become irritable, possibly even irrational. . You have difficulty focusing and concentrating. . Your muscles ache, making movement difficult.<br><br>Chances are, you recognize most of these symptoms. But now imagine weeks to months of poor sleep and how this can lead to premature aging, weight gain, and even a larger abdomen. I see the following problems almost daily in my female patients.<br><br>Poor Complexion and Bad Hair<br><br>Poor sleep can make you look older. You can see the effects of sleep loss when you look in your bathroom mirror in the morning. Lack of sleep can make your skin look swollen and ashen and can accentuate the deep reddish blue color under your eyes (dark circles). In addition, because sleep deprivation leads to poor circulation (circulation is how hair and skin get their nutrients), poor sleep is linked to facial wrinkles and thinning hair.<br><br>PROBLEMS LINKED TO SLEEP LOSS</p><h2>The Children of Men</h2><p>Told with P.

The human race has become infertile, and the last generation to be born is now adult. Civilization itself is crumbling as suicide and despair become commonplace. Oxford historian Theodore Faron, apathetic toward a future without a future, spends most of his time reminiscing. Then he is approached by Julian, a bright, attractive woman who wants him to help get her an audience with his cousin, the powerful Warden of England. She and her band of unlikely revolutionaries may just awaken his desire to live . . . and they may also hold the key to survival for the human race.</p><p>P. D.

If the first reports are to be believed, Joseph Ricardo died as he had lived. The distinction, if one can call it that, of being the last human whose birth was officially recorded, unrelated as it was to any personal virtue or talent, had always been difficult for him to handle. And now he is dead. The news was given to us here in Britain on the nine o&#x2019;clock programme of the State Radio Service and I heard it fortuitously. I had settled down to begin this diary of the last half of my life when I noticed the time and thought I might as well catch the headlines to the nine o&#x2019;clock bulletin. Ricardo&#x2019;s death was the last item mentioned, and then only briefly, a couple of sentences delivered without emphasis in the newscaster&#x2019;s carefully non-committal voice. But it seemed to me, hearing it, that it was a small additional justification for beginning the diary today; the first day of a new year and my fiftieth birthday. As a child I had always liked that distinction, despite the inconvenience of having it follow Christmas too quickly so that one present &#x2013; it never seemed notably superior to the one I would in any case have received &#x2013; had to do for both celebrations.<br><br>As I begin writing, the three events, the New Year, my fiftieth birthday, Ricardo&#x2019;s death, hardly justify sullying the first pages of this new loose-leaf notebook. But I shall continue, one small additional defence against personal accidie. If there is nothing to record, I shall record the nothingness and then if, and when, I reach old age &#x2013; as most of us can expect to, we have become experts at prolonging life &#x2013; I shall open one of my tins of hoarded matches and light my small personal bonfire of vanities. I have no intention of leaving the diary as a record of one man&#x2019;s last years. Even in my most egotistical moods I am not as self-deceiving as that. What possible interest can there be in the journal of Theodore Faron, Doctor of Philosophy, Fellow of Merton College in the University of Oxford, historian of the Victorian age, divorced, childless, solitary, whose only claim to notice is that he is cousin to Xan Lyppiatt, the dictator and Warden of England. No additional personal record is, in any case, necessary. All over the world nation states are preparing to store their testimony for the posterity which we can still occasionally convince ourselves may follow us, those creatures from another planet who may land on this green wilderness and ask what kind of sentient life once inhabited it. We are storing our books and manuscripts, the great paintings, the musical scores and instruments, the artefacts. The world&#x2019;s greatest libraries will in forty years&#x2019; time at most be darkened and sealed. The buildings, those that are still standing, will speak for themselves. The soft stone of Oxford is unlikely to survive more than a couple of centuries. Already the University is arguing about whether it is worth refacing the crumbling Sheldonian. But I like to think of those mythical creatures landing in St. Peter&#x2019;s Square and entering the great Basilica, silent and echoing under the centuries of dust. Will they realize that this was once the greatest of man&#x2019;s temples to one of his many gods? Will they be curious about his nature, this deity who was worshipped with such pomp and splendour, intrigued by the mystery of his symbol, at once so simple, the two crossed sticks, ubiquitous in nature, yet laden with gold, gloriously jewelled and adorned? Or will their values and their thought processes be so alien to ours that nothing of awe or wonder will be able to touch them? But despite the discovery &#x2013; in 1997 was it? &#x2013; of a planet which the astronomers told us could support life, few of us really believe that they will come. They must be there. It is surely unreasonable to credit that only one small star in the immensity of the universe is capable of developing and supporting intelligent life. But we shall not get to them and they will not come to us.<br><br>Twenty years ago, when the world was already half convinced that our species had lost for ever the power to reproduce, the search to find the last-known human birth became a universal obsession, elevated to a matter of national pride, an international contest as ultimately pointless as it was fierce and acrimonious. To qualify the birth had to be officially notified, the date and precise time recorded. This effectively excluded a high proportion of the human race where the day but not the hour was known, and it was accepted, but not emphasized, that the result could never be conclusive. Almost certainly in some remote jungle, in some primitive hut, the last human being had slipped largely unnoticed into an unregarding world. But after months of checking and re-checking, Joseph Ricardo, of mixed race, born illegitimately in a Buenos Aires hospital at two minutes past three Western time on 19 October 1995, had been officially recognized. Once the result was proclaimed, he was left to exploit his celebrity as best he could while the world, as if suddenly aware of the futility of the exercise, turned its attention elsewhere. And now he is dead and I doubt whether any country will be eager to drag the other candidates from oblivion.<br><br>We are outraged and demoralized less by the impending end of our species, less even by our inability to prevent it, than by our failure to discover the cause. Western science and Western medicine haven&#x2019;t prepared us for the magnitude and humiliation of this ultimate failure. There have been many diseases which have been difficult to diagnose or cure and one which almost depopulated two continents before it spent itself. But we have always in the end been able to explain why. We have given names to the viruses and germs which, even today, take possession of us, much to our chagrin since it seems a personal affront that they should still assail us, like old enemies who keep up the skirmish and bring down the occasional victim when their victory is assured. Western science has been our god. In the variety of its power it has preserved, comforted, healed, warmed, fed and entertained us and we have felt free to criticize and occasionally reject it as men have always rejected their gods, but in the knowledge that despite our apostasy, this deity, our creature and our slave, would still provide for us; the anaesthetic for the pain, the spare heart, the new lung, the antibiotic, the moving wheels and the moving pictures. The light will always come on when we press the switch and if it doesn&#x2019;t we can find out why. Science was never a subject I was at home with. I understood little of it at school and I understand little more now that I&#x2019;m fifty. Yet it has been my god too, even if its achievements are incomprehensible to me, and I share the universal disillusionment of those whose god has died. I can clearly remember the confident words of one biologist spoken when it had finally become apparent that nowhere in the whole world was there a pregnant woman: &#x201c;It may take us some time to discover the cause of this apparent universal infertility.&#x201d; We have had twenty-five years and we no longer even expect to succeed. Like a lecherous stud suddenly stricken with impotence, we are humiliated at the very heart of our faith in ourselves. For all our knowledge, our intelligence, our power, we can no longer do what the animals do without thought. No wonder we both worship and resent them.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>American Rebellion (Doomsday Warrior)</h2><p>One hundred years after Russia&#39;s World War III victory, the Soviets unwittingly capture the famous Ted Rockson, who is suffering a loss of memory</p><p></p><h2>The Historical Atlas of the Civil War</h2><p><p>This book explains the seeds of the conflict, and examines important topics such as the development and use of new tactics and weapons, the roles of the great commanders, the maritime war, and the war&#x2019;s painful aftermath.

National ad/promo. BOMC Main.</p><p>Literate, sybaritic, ecumenical. Uplifting to body and spirit. <b>The Whole World Loves Chicken Soup</b>, Mimi Sheraton's timeless study on what some consider the elixir of life, is all of these. This comprehensive treatise on what is arguably one of the world's ubiquitous dishes includes what kind of chicken and pot to use to be sure your soup will be golden rich and lean. Along with over 100 recipes for chicken-based soups and a full panoply of dumplings, meat balls, noodles, and piroshiki to go with them, this book is also studded with historical, geographic, and cultural tidbits. If you wonder how much can be done with a bird simmered in liquid, the chapters on soups from Latin America, the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia are edifying. Sheraton's passion, warmth, generosity and meticulous attention to accuracy make this book a culinary classic.Jewish yentas may be famous for their chicken soup, but they aren't the only ones who know how to cook up a savory broth. So says veteran cookbook author Sheraton, who looks to her Jewish roots as well as to places as far flung as Italy, Scotland, Nigeria, and Aruba for some of the recipes in this very special volume. After a lesson in "basic soupmanship" that even experienced cooks will appreciate, Sheraton jumps to her home court, providing soup versions from Jewish traditions, complete with recipes for kreplach and matzo balls. Then it's on to everywhere else for intriguing chicken-based soups (and accompaniments), ranging from chicken and eggplant and moldavian sour soup to baked chicken custard and Aztec tortilla soup. With a text as lively as the recipes, this will be great for well-used cookery collections. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>Betty Bib&#39;s Fairy Field Guide: The Illustrated Handbook of Fairies and Their Habitats by Betty Bib (2005-05-04)</h2><p>In this field guide, Betty Bib, a celebrated fairy collector, now turned fairy protector, tells you all you need to know about spotting, identifying and attracting this elusive genus of wildlife.</p><p></p><h2>Driving on the Rim</h2><p>From one of America&#x2019;s most acclaimed literary figures (&#x201c;an important as well as brilliant novelist&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) a major new novel that hilariously takes the pulse of our times.<br><br>The unforgettable voyager of this dark comic journey is I. B. &#x201c;Berl&#x201d; Pickett, M.D., the die of whose uncharmed life was probably cast as soon as his mother got the bright idea to name him after Irving Berlin. The boyhood insults to any chance of normalcy piled on apace thereafter: the traumatizing, spasmodic spectacle of Pentecostalist Sunday worship; the socially inhibitory accompaniment of his parents on their itinerant rug-shampooing business; the undue technical advancement and emotional retardation that ensued from his erotic initiation at the hands of his aunt. What would have become of this soul had he not gone to medical school, thanks to the surrogate parenting of a local physician and solitary bird hunter? <br><br>But there is meaning to life beyond professional accreditation, even in the noblest of callings. Berl&#x2019;s been on a mission to find it these past few years, though with scant equipment or basis for hope. Hard to say (for the moment anyway) whether his mission has been aided or set back by his having fallen under suspicion of negligent homicide in the death of his former lover. All the same, being ostracized by virtually all his colleagues at the clinic gives him something to chew on: the reality of small-town living as total surveillance more than any semblance of fellowship, even among folks you&#x2019;ve known your whole life.<br><br>Fortunately, for Berl, it doesn&#x2019;t take a village. And he will find his deliverance in continuing to practice medicine one way or another, as well as in the few human connections he has made, wittingly or not, over the years. The landscape, too, will furnish a hint in what might yet prove, if not a certifiable epiphany, a semi-spiritual awakening in I. B. Pickett, M.D., the inglorious but sole hero of Thomas McGuane&#x2019;s uproarious and profound exploration of the threads by which we all are hanging.</p><p>Thomas McGuane lives on a ranch in McLeod, Montana. He is the author of nine novels, three works of nonfiction, and two collections of stories.<br><br>www.tommcguane.com1<br><br>My name is Berl Pickett, Dr. Berl Pickett. But I sign checks and documents &#x201c;I. B. Pickett,&#x201d; and this requires some explanation. My very forceful mother, a patriot and evangelical Christian, named me after the author of &#x201c;God Bless America&#x201d;; so, I am Irving Berlin Pickett and well aware of the absurdity of my name. My father wanted Lefty Frizzell Pickett. That would have been worse. In any case, my very name illustrates the borrowed nature of my life, not easily denied. In fact, I&#x2019;ve learned to enjoy my circumstances as I have moved among people trapped in their homes, jobs, and families&#x2014;and their names! My esteemed colleague Alan Hirsch, mountaineer and cardiologist, calls me Irving, with a chuckle. When I first arrived at our clinic from the Indian Health Service, Dr. Hirsch told me that I couldn&#x2019;t call myself a physician until I had delivered babies to ambivalent parents or taught the old to accept their grotesque new faces. I don&#x2019;t know about that, but I do abide in the conviction that I&#x2019;ve come a long way, and lately I&#x2019;ve wondered how this all happened.<br><br>L. Raymond Hoxey bought an old mansion in Livingston, Montana, and converted the third floor into a delightful apartment with a view of the Absaroka Mountains. The second floor housed his print collection in archival conditions, with humidifiers and air-quality equipment. The first floor was divided into two smaller but still comfortable apartments, one of which was home to his assistant, Tessa Larionov, and the other, in summer, to a textile historian employed by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, who was also a trout fisherman.<br><br>The year the historian died, I was still in pre-med and painting houses to support myself; I moved into his vacated apartment. Acknowledging that there is a difference between being naive and being innocent, I will say that I was entirely naive. My parents lived a few miles away, but we weren&#x2019;t getting along and I needed some distance, despite the fact that my mother was sick and often ranted about God. There are many versions of God around the world, but my mother&#x2019;s was definitely a guy, and a mean one. Like many aspiring to study medicine, I planned to get rich but I wasn&#x2019;t rich yet; I was just a poor house painter&#x2014;out of work and looking for whatever came along&#x2014;and despite all other evidence, I feared that I would be one forever, packing a great wheel of color chips from one indifferent house to another. I don&#x2019;t mean to suggest mild insecurity here: by any reasonable standard, I was losing my mind.<br><br>Tessa Larionov was the daughter of a Russian engineer who had immigrated to the United States in 1953 and found his way to Montana, where he set up business building bridges for the railroad. His offices were in Choteau, where Tessa was born and grew up. Tessa&#x2019;s mother was not Russian; her father had met her in New Jersey, where he first landed. She may have been Italian. Tessa was a powerfully built but attractive woman, with black hair, black eyes, and the look of a Tartar, wry and a little dangerous. She was liked by everyone who knew her. Trained in library science, she had worked as an archivist at some very august places, including the Huntington, in Pasadena, where she&#x2019;d met her future employer and our landlord, L. Raymond Hoxey, who had let Tessa talk him into retiring to Montana to run his rare-prints business with her help. Hoxey was eighty-one years old, and his arrangement with Tessa was a means of avoiding assisted living. She was very fond of him and had wanted to go home to Montana, and so it worked for both of them. Tessa was exactly thirty, still single, though she had enjoyed an active love life, leaving in her wake only grateful hearts, or so she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re all still crazy about me,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I left California.&#x201d; Settling down was of no interest; she&#x2019;d grown absorbed with the prints, and she wanted to keep her eye on Hoxey. I was twenty, but she treated me as if I were even younger&#x2014;a salute to my retarded behavior.<br><br>My father had worked briefly as a pipe fitter for the Northern Pacific Railroad. In the course of corporate takeovers, the railroad had actually changed its name several times, but Northern Pacific was the one that stuck in all our minds. It meant something. Burlington Northern meant nothing. Then he had a little stock farm he liked to call a ranch, whose main purpose was to let him keep horses. But he lost it to the bank and went to work for the post office. My mother was a hairdresser and, because of her big mouth and religious mania, had enemies all over southwestern Montana and very few customers. During my childhood, they had had a traveling rug-cleaning business, and the three of us saw most of the West as we towed the steamer behind our van, an old-fashioned Steam Jenny with an oil-filled crankcase and a picture of a Vargas-type girl in black nylons emblazoned on its side&#x2014;wonderful years, really. As an only child, I was all but homeschooled, then run back and forth between our house and the less fashionable of the two grade schools, before going to the local high school, where I was anonymous, never having been allowed by my overprotective mother to learn a sport. My mother joined one Pentecostal church after another, followed by my father, whose skepticism had long ago evaporated in the heat of her enthusiasm; they stopped just short of snake handling. But I liked to fish; I&#x2019;d fish wherever there was water, and I fished in a lot of ditches where there was no hope of success. I now understand that I was for my age a weirdly underdeveloped human being, ripe for the sort of encounter I had with Tessa Larionov. Even my mother noticed my immaturity; she was always telling me, &#x201c;Stop staring at people!&#x201d; But she had once given me a gift beyond price: looking down at me when I was a little boy, she said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re an old soul. You&#x2019;ve been here before.&#x201d;<br><br>It was Hoxey whom I got to know first. The day I arranged to rent from him, he happened to have received several Reginald Marsh prints, of which he was very proud and which he wanted me to see. I acted like I&#x2019;d heard of Reginald Marsh. I didn&#x2019;t know one painter from another, but I had a hunger for this sort of information; I felt it would be useful later, when I was rich. Hoxey was a pleasant old man who must have once been very fat, because he had loose flesh hanging from him everywhere and as many as seven chins. I always tried to count them while he was speaking to me, but then something in his remarks would break my concentration. This physicality, which bespoke a lifetime of phlegmatic living, gave his discourse on prints the authority of a weathered desert rat holding forth on cactus. I remember him carefully unpacking one of the prints&#x2014;a kind of crazy thing with blank-faced people swarming in and out of doorways, none of them reacting to anyone else. Hoxey said that it was the calmest Reginald Marsh he&#x2019;d ever seen. &#x201c;No &#x2018;Moonlight and Pretzels&#x2019; in this one!&#x201d; he cried. I could see both that he&#x2019;d be an agreeable landlord and that many health issues lay before him. As someone aspiring to be a doctor, I could make a little game of guessing which one would kill him.<br><br>Tessa asked me over one night for drinks. She had done a beautiful job of making her apartment habitable, with comfortable old furniture that she&#x2019;d bought cheap and upholstered. She also had a good many of Hoxey&#x2019;s prints on loan, though, as she explained, she was really just storing them, and her collection changed as things were sold from Hoxey&#x2019;s inventory. She made a little face when she told me that she couldn&#x2019;t afford to get attached to any of the prints, quite a trial for her, as she loved the art of all nations. Cocktails and art, I thought; maybe I&#x2019;ll get into her pants. I&#x2019;m sure that at the time I had a big goober smile on my face as I contemplated such an outcome. Tessa said I reminded her of Li&#x2019;l Abner.<br><br>&#x201c;Because I work upstairs, I&#x2019;ve had to become a walker just to get outside,&#x201d; she said, making our drinks in a blender. &#x201c;You start getting curious about different neighborhoods&#x2014;where the railroaders lived, where the ranchers retired, where the doctors and bankers lived. In the winter, when the wind is up, I have to tie a scarf over my face. Anybody you see in the street is ducking for a building, kind of like in the Blitz.&#x201d;<br><br>As I waited for my drink, I found myself leaning forward in my chair with my hands pressed between my knees. It was only when she stopped to look at me that I realized my posture was strange. I pretended that I was just stretching and leaned back in an apparently casual but quite uncomfortable position. As Tessa came toward me with a brightly colored drink, both she and it seemed to be expanding, and when she handed me the drink I wasn&#x2019;t sure I was strong enough to hold it. I felt suddenly that everything was bigger than me, that I was in over my head, trying to handle a situation which, when I was rich, I would take to like a duck to water. But things settled down quickly as soon as she returned to her seat, and I was then glad to have the drink because I was a bit cotton-mouthed. I had gone from my first impulse of getting into her pants to fearing that she&#x2019;d try to get into mine.<br><br>I was not much of a drinker; water would have served as well. That summer I&#x2019;d made an experimental foray into a local bar, feeling that I needed to learn to be more social. I struck up a conversation with a somber middle-aged fellow in a rumpled suit. He looked so gloomy that I regaled him with what I felt were uplifting accounts of my struggles at school. He stared at me for a while, until I sensed that all the timing was disappearing from my delivery. Finally he said, &#x201c;Hey, boss, I got to go. You&#x2019;re creeping me out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Tessa said, &#x201c;let&amp;rsqu...</p><h2>It Worked For Me Unabridged CD</h2><p>Colin Powell, one of America&#x2019;s most admired public figures, reveals the principles that have shaped his life and career in this inspiring and engrossing memoir. A beautiful companion to his previous memoir, the #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>My American Journey</em>, Powell&#x2019;s <em>It Worked for Me: In Life and Leadership </em>is a trove of wisdom for anyone hoping to achieve their goals and turn their dreams into reality. A message of strength and endurance from a man who has dedicated his life to public service, <em>It Worked for Me </em>is a book with the power to show readers everywhere how to achieve a more fulfilling life and career.&nbsp; <br></p><p>A Note from Colin Powell on It Worked for Me <p>I love stories. In the course of my career I gathered a number of them that mean a lot to me. Most come from my military life. I was in the military from age seventeen as an ROTC cadet until I was a retired GI at age fifty-six. Others came from my service as Secretary of State and as National Security Advisor. Yet others came to me as I wandered through life. In this book I want to share with you a selection of these stories as well as experiences that have stayed with me over the years. Each one of them taught me something important about life and leadership. Some of the stories deal with serious aspects of my life, including some of the controversial issues I was involved in during my tenure as Secretary of State. There are also humorous stories from my life as well. I offer them to you for whatever use you may wish to make of them. </p> <p>The first part of It Worked for Me explains my Thirteen Rules, which have been bouncing around since they were first published in Magazine over twenty years ago. These are rules that I have gathered over the years and to which I&#x2019;ve adhered in my career. </p> <p><b>CLP's Thirteen Rules:</b></p> <li>It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.</li> <li>Get mad, then get over it.</li> <li>Avoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.</li> <li>It can be done!</li> <li>Be careful what you choose. You may get it.</li> <li>Don't let adverse facts stand in the way of a good decision.</li> <li>You can't make someone else's choices. You shouldn't let someone else make yours.</li> <li>Check small things.</li> <li>Share credit.</li> <li>Remain calm. Be kind.</li> <li>Have a vision. Be demanding.</li> <li>Don't take counsel of your fears or naysayers.</li> <li>Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.</li> <p>The rest of the book focuses on everything from the importance of really knowing who you are and how to always be yourself to why I put an emphasis on knowing and taking care of others, especially those who are your followers. I go into my experience in the exploding digital realm that has reshaped the world and our lives. I talk about how to be a great manager and a great leader. I give no conclusions or recommendations, just my observations. The chapters are free-standing. You can read them straight through or jump in anywhere. Everyone has life lessons and stories. These are mine. All I can say is that they worked for me. --Colin Powell </p><p><em>It Worked for Me</em> is filled with vivid experiences and lessons learned that have shaped the legendary career of the four-star general and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. At its heart are Powell's "Thirteen Rules"&#x2014;such as "Get mad, then get over it" and "Share credit"&#x2014;that introduce his principles for effective leadership: conviction, hard work, and, above all, respect for others.</p><p>A natural storyteller, Powell offers warm and engaging parables with wise advice on succeeding in the workplace and beyond. "Trust your people," he counsels as he delegates presidential briefing responsibilities to two junior State Department desk officers. "Do your best&#x2014;someone is watching," he advises those just starting out, recalling his own teenage job mopping floors in a factory. Powell combines the insight he gained in the military and four presidential administrations with lessons from his immigrant-family upbringing in the Bronx and his training in the ROTC. The result is a powerful portrait of a leader who is reflective, self-effacing, and grateful for everyone he works with.</p><p>A brilliant and original blueprint for leadership, Colin Powell's <em>It Worked for Me</em> is bound to inspire, move, and surprise readers.</p></p><h2>Ravenheart: A Novel of The Rigante</h2><p><br><b><i>When it comes to the crackle of action, high adventure, lush worlds, and vivid magic, bestselling author David Gemmell is the master.

In that time, Connavar has become a legend, and the Rigante have lost the freedom so many gave their lives to preserve. A conquered people, they live and die under the iron rule of the Varlish, their culture all but destroyed.

One will become the Ravenheart, an outlaw leader whose daring exploits will inspire the Rigante. The other will forge a legend&#x2013;and light the fires of revolution.<br><br>But in truth, all hope may ultimately rest on a third man: a man who must overcome generations of fear and hatred to fulfill his destiny.

Gorgeously designed, handsomely bound, and abundantly illustrated, this is the first book ever to present the 100-year history of a leader in men&#x2019;s luxury clothing and one of the oldest business families in Italy. As a family business, Ermenegildo Zegna goes back to the second half of the nineteenth century. Angelo Zegna a watchmaker by trade, decided to open a wool mill. Of his ten children it was the last, Ermenegildo, born in 1892, who took over what was to become one of the best-known and most dynamic family businesses in Italy. The extensive historical reconstruction of the early decades of Ermenegildo Zegna S.p.A. is followed by a detailed description of the fabrics, techniques, and custom tailoring of its most exclusive garments. Numerous images illustrate the lands providing the raw materials: Australia, Peru, and Mongolia. Just as spectacular is the photo album of the celebrities and spokespersons wearing Zegna, the international advertising campaigns, the list of awards won, and Zegna-sponsored sports and cultural affairs (red carpets, openings, car races, environmental and sports events).</p><p>James Hillman is an American psychologist.

They comfort each other amid the ashes of failed relationships and in hospital waiting rooms. They try to locate themselves in a world where all the old landmarks have been turned into theme parks. Funny and sorrowful, fiercely compressed yet emotionally<br>expansive, <b>Park City</b> is dazzling.</p><p>Ann Beattie arrived on the literary scene in the early 1970s, publishing the first of her carefully understated short stories in the <i>New Yorker</i> and becoming something of a legend for the speed with which she worked--22 stories in a year, and a complete draft of her first novel, <i>Chilly Scenes of Winter</i>, in three weeks. Time has not slowed Beattie down--her fifth collection, <i>Park City</i>, follows hard on the heels of her fifth novel, <i>My Life, Starring Dara Falcon</i>, providing a kind of symmetry to her output. Lest you think Beattie is some kind of perpetual writing machine, however, be forewarned that only 8 of the 36 stories in this collection have not been previously published in book form; the rest are selected from earlier collections, thus offering an interesting survey of how the writer has changed--and how she hasn't. <p> From the start of her career, Beattie has been compared to Cheever and Updike, chroniclers of the chilly middle classes, and also to Raymond Carver, master practitioner of that school of literature known as minimalism. Beattie's stories seem smaller than life in some ways, depending as they do on an accretion of detail to round out her characters' lives. In her world, as in our own, there are no grand epiphanies, no moments of blinding realization. Instead, her characters muddle through their days in a series of small events that culminate in a whisper instead of a bang. In "Going Home with Uccello," for example, a woman on holiday with her lover in Italy watches him interact with a woman in a museum gift shop and realizes his true purpose for the trip is not to convince her to make a commitment to him, but rather to "persuade himself that he loved her so much that no one else could be a distraction--that no other woman could come between them." In "What Was Mine" another nameless narrator--male, this time--claims his inheritance from the man who had been his widowed mother's lover and the only father figure he'd ever known: </p><blockquote> There was sheet music inside: six Billie Holiday songs that I recognized immediately as Herb's favorites for ending the last set of the evening. There were several notes, which I suppose you could call love notes, from my mother. There was a tracing, on a food-stained Merry Mariner place mat, of a cherry, complete with stem, and a fancy pencil-drawn frame around it that I vaguely remembered Herb having drawn one night. There was also a white envelope that contained the two pictures of one of the soldiers on Guam; one of a handsome young man looking impassively at a sleeping young baby. I knew the second I saw it that he was my father. </blockquote> Understanding, such as it is, comes in the quiet moments, in the exchange of glances in a gift shop, or the transposed captions on a couple of photographs. <p> Over the years, Beattie has continued to map the psychological and emotional territory of the urban, the educated, the neurotic middle class. On those occasions when her stories are set outside of New York--Vermont, Park City, Utah, Italy--her characters are generally <i>from</i> there, or at least from another large city such as Los Angeles. Beattie's prose has always been crisp, smart with just a touch of the smart aleck to it--on occasion she can be remarkably funny. But there's a chilliness in her stories that discourages the reader from getting too close, or investing too much. Her often nameless narrators tell their tales in the modulated tones of well-brought-up people for whom not wearing one's heart on one's sleeve is a religion. And yet in their spare revelations of loss and disappointment, their timid essays to the borderlands of hope, more often than not these characters <i>do</i> get under your skin. Depending on your tolerance for ambiguity, they can either irritate or captivate. Beattie's work tends to play to the intellect rather than the gut. For readers looking for a shot to the cerebellum, she satisfies; for those who prefer their fiction warm-blooded, <i>Park City</i> might be a trifle too cool. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"There is a kind of magnificence to Ann Beattie's <b>Park City</b>. . . . One feels amazed at the confidence, steadiness and quality of [her work]." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> (front page)<br><br>"Like a boxed set of Miles Davis CDs . . . both superb in itself and an essential piece of history. . . .

Reprint.</p><p>Stanley Elkin (1930-1995) was an award-winning author of novels, short stories, and essays. Born in the Bronx, Elkin received his BA and PhD from the University of Illinois and in 1960 became a professor of English at Washington University in St. Louis where he taught until his death. His critically acclaimed works include the National Book Critics Circle Award-winners &#34;George Mills&#34; (1982) and &#34;Mrs. Ted Bliss&#34; (1995), as well as the National Book Award finalists &#34;The Dick Gibson Show&#34; (1972), &#34;Searches and Seizures &#34;(1974), and &#34;The MacGuffin&#34; (1991). His book of novellas, &#34;Van Gogh&#39;s Room at Arles&#34;, was a finalist for the PEN Faulkner Award.This short novel exhibits the author&#39;s sardonic fatalism, a kind of humor so dark that, before the work closes, it&#39;s more sad--or angry--than funny. A basically good man dies in a stickup, finds himself in hell, whence proceed comic misadventures. Elkin gives his dramatis personae an endearing quality--except for God, who is a petulant, willful despot. George Guidall, one of the best audiobook narrators, misses none of the beats. Wisely, he reads with a comic tone, but without the comic timing of gags that would turn satire into the Three Stooges. He stints on none of the drama, yet pulls back on the bigger moments to keep them from turning bathetic. His interpretation conjures up a phantasmagoria by Hieronymus Bosch in a prankish mood. If he errs, it&#39;s in his inability to give Joseph, a minor character here as in the New Testament, the Yiddish inflections the author wrote for him. There is something of Dostoyevsky as much as of Elkin in Guidall&#39;s horrifically funny afterlife, something bigger than the text he reads from. Y.R. An AUDIOFILE Earphones Award winner (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Dorothy Wordsworth</h2><p>Critics and biographers have too often regarded Dorothy Wordsworth as a mere adjunct to her brother William, or to their mutual friend Samuel Coleridge. The importance of her famous Journals and other writings, it is usually assumed, lies in what they tell us of those poets and their work. This thoughtful, compelling biography is the first book to treat Dorothy Wordsworth as a person in her own right.<br> Drawing on the Journals, her newly re-edited Letters, and later diary material not yet published, the authors give us a portait of a woman more strange yet touchingly human than any previous account has offered. Their interest in her does not stop at the "literary" but goes deeper to explore other facets of her character. They focus especially on her intense familial and domestic devotion, showing us how, from early childhood, she extended her warmth and selflessness to anyone who seemed to need her--a trait that tells us much about her particular intimate attachment to her brother. The book fully explores her relationship with William--their life in the Lake District, their travels together, her influence on how he came to view nature--and also examines the effects upon Dorothy of a changing social and political climate. It delves into her problems, weaknesses, and contradictions and illuminates the nature of her tragic nervous breakdown, which virtually incapacitated her for the last 25 years of her life.<br> As a revealing picture of a woman of the early nineteenth century, Dorothy Wordsworth has an appeal extending well beyond just those readers interested in the Romantic Period.<br><br>About the Author:<br><br>Robert Gittings has written acclaimed biographies of Keats and Hardy. Jo Manton is the author of Elizabeth Barrett Anderson and Sister Dora. Husband and wife, they have previously collaborated on The Story of John Keats and The Second Mrs. Hardy.</p><p>Dorothy Wordsworth has often been recognized as a poor relation to her illustrious brother William and their friends Coleridge, De Quincey, and Lamb, but she has rarely been considered in her own right. This well-researched and engaging biography not only portrays a sensitive, keenly observant and talented writer but also represents the hardships of rural poverty in Georgian England. The detailed account of her daily life illustrates the restrictive domestic demands that inhibited the fulfillment of Dorothy's artistic potential. Although the authors offer little critical analysis of her strengths and limitations as a writer, they provide well chosen extracts from her journals and letters. They give a carefully documented account of her troubled and brittle life (including a debatable diagnosis of her long senescence) and a new perspective of relationships among the Wordsworth circle.

The book plods through basic marketing precepts such as finding your ideal client, honing your message, being memorable, and making your Web site work for you. The chapters that draw from the author's Web expertise provide a solid overview of creating productive Web sites and automated referral systems. But too many chapters provide only a bland overview of familiar material without providing interesting case studies to illustrate the author's prescriptions. For example, chapter 10, on garnering media attention, starts with a 24-year-old example of a man who got a rush of publicity from offering to sell the Brooklyn Bridge, followed by boilerplate advice on writing press releases and updating media lists.

These are practically dictatorial methods we're talking about." </i><br><br>Sixteen years before Democratic Senator Bruce Jansen was elected president of the United States, a PR stunt brought together five very different people: fourteen-year-old Dorothy "Doggie" Rogers, small-town sheriff T.

In spite of their differences, the five remain bonded by their shared experience and devotion to their candidate.<br><br>For Doggie, who worked the campaign trail with Wesley, Jansen's election is a personal victory: a job in the White House, proof to her Republican father that she was right to support Jansen, and the rise of an intelligent, clear-headed leader with her same ideals. But the triumph is short-lived: Jansen's pregnant wife is assassinated on election night, and the alleged mastermind behind the shooting is none other than Doggie's own father. <br><br>When Jansen ascends to the White House, he is a changed man, determined to end gun violence by any means necessary. Rights are taken away as quickly as weapons. International travel becomes impossible. Checkpoints and roadblocks destroy infrastructure. The media is censored.

The country is in chaos, and Jansen's former friends each find themselves fighting a very different battle, for themselves, their rights, their country . . . and, in Doggie's case, the life of her father, who just may be innocent.</p><p><b>Jussi Adler-Olsen </b>is Denmark's #1 crime writer and a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author.

In Doggie's case the ending couldn't have been worse.<br><br> It all began with Governor Jansen's office sending Virginia's biggest local television station a suggestion for a new quiz show, plus the capital to get it off the ground.<br><br> It was to be a geographical quiz where everyone who could correctly name China's most populous city was invited to participate. The TV station went for the idea.<br><br> After the initial elimination round, only forty-eight participants were left, and among them-quite sensationally-was a fourteen-year-old girl. The excitement rose for four weeks: Both the sponsor, Leatherman Auto Tires, and Governor Jansen's campaign office wanted to get their money's worth.<br><br> The first programs were broadcast in the afternoon, but the show quickly found its way into prime time. A good three-quarters of Virginians followed the event on their TV screens. This was a new viewer record.<br><br> Throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia, people bet on the outcome. Each had his or her favorite. But most, by far, backed the girl with the dimples, who was also the youngest contestant: Dorothy Curtis, also known as Doggie.<br><br> Three weeks and three episodes later, Virginia's TV audience finally got their three winners-and what winners they were! Governor Jansen beamed like a Hollywood star, the host had his wages doubled, and the newspapers went crazy. With the exception of a blonde with silicone breasts and full hips who lost out in the last round (but instead got her own talk show on which to display her attributes), the winners couldn't have been more popular.<br><br> First prize went to Rosalie Lee, a big African-American woman from New York who happened to be in Virginia for the first time, visiting her sister Josefine. Rosalie was a showpiece of a woman, with pearly teeth, roaring laughter, and winks to the audience, and few could match her talent of using so much time to answer a question that the audience was about to go crazy.<br><br> Only one point behind her came T. Perkins, a pale-faced, practically albino sheriff, who came from one of the smallest counties in the northwestern part of the state. A man who, in his youth, had been one of the nation's best dart players. And finally, in an impressive third place came Doggie Curtis, the girl with the dimples. What a triumph! The winners couldn't have been more different, and everyone involved with the show was pleased. How could any part of the population feel overlooked with those three? It simply wasn't possible.<br><br> The lucky winners couldn't believe it when they heard their prize being announced live on the show. Along with the graduated cash jackpots came nothing less than a trip to the other side of the world for the three of them.<br><br> For Doggie especially, it was all unreal and incredible. They were to travel to China with Governor Bruce Jansen, his staff, and an official Chinese delegation. They'd be entering a closed world, and everything would be paid for.<br><br> It sounded like a fairy tale.<br><br> Doggie's father was proud about his daughter being so bright, but not about her prize. He was a right-wing Republican and hated Bruce Jansen, who was "old money" and a Democrat besides.<br><br> "Jansen? That swine?" he yelled at her. "You don't plan to participate in a PR stunt like that, advancing the ambitions of that fucking untrustworthy Democrat, do you?!" He forbid her going, and Doggie's mother was forced to use all her powers of persuasion to make him change his mind.<br><br> As fate would have it, this was the last time Doggie heard them quarrel. Her parents were divorced just five months later, a divorce that descended into a fight over money and custody of their child. Doggie ended up being installed in her mother's house with her mother's maiden name.<br><br> In a way her father was right. It was all a PR stunt, but so what? Governor Jansen was a clever man. He'd taken three ordinary people and made them everybody's darlings, and via them, invited Virginia's entire population of seven million souls along to a far-off, enigmatic land. It was practically the only thing folks talked and read about. School newspapers, ladies' magazines, and even Doggie's father's boring hotel business newsletter wrote about it. And everyone wanted to talk with Doggie. She'd been approached by twenty-one of Virginia's thirty-four newspapers, either for interviews or to publish the last month's entries in her diary.<br><br> It was quite an achievement: Bruce Jansen had embraced the entire population all at once, and vice versa. He may have been calculating, but a swine he was not. He was quite fantastic, actually.<br><br> Doggie's heart was pounding as she bid her mother farewell and ascended the portable stairway to the huge airplane, glittering in the sunshine. She'd flown at least twenty times within the States, plus to Mexico and Puerto Rico, but never in a plane that size. It was a little frightening.<br><br> When she reached her seat, Sheriff T. Perkins was already in the next seat by the window, looking sleepy and absentmindedly cleaning his fingernails with the point of a gilded dart. Governor Jansen's wife, Caroll Jansen, came over and patted her on the cheek. "You're a clever girl, Doggie," she said. "It was wonderful, you winning third place. Just magnificent. I think we're going to have a fine time together, we two." She nodded graciously to a few of the passengers and sat down a couple of rows forward, between her husband and his indispensable right hand, Thomas Sunderland.<br><br> Then Rosalie Lee came blustering down the aisle. She gave everyone a hearty greeting and planted herself next to Doggie, her bulk flowing over onto Doggie's seat. She immediately emptied a giant paper bag of Coca-Cola cans, crackers, chips, and a great variety of candy bars and began offering goodies to all her neighbors. It had been like that in the TV studio, too. No one in Rosalie Lee's company was going to go hungry if she had anything to say about it.<br><br> Chewing away on her portable feast, she entertained Doggie with talk of New York, her little apartment in the Bronx, and her three wonderful sons, finishing with peals of laughter as she described how she'd kicked her loser of a husband out of her home, ass first.<br><br> Rosalie's unrestrained laughter woke Sheriff T. Perkins up a bit, and he looked around in bewilderment. He was pretty easygoing-slept now and then and didn't say much. He'd clearly been the most knowledgeable of the three quiz winners, but even though Rosalie Lee had sometimes seemed slow-witted, appearances were deceptive. Her brain was capable of changing gears suddenly and leaving everyone in the dust, and that was how she wound up winning the contest.<br><br> A couple of hours later, a young man who'd been sleeping since takeoff leaned his head towards the row of prizewinners in front of him. "Wesley Barefoot." He presented himself with luminous teeth. "Well, looks like we're going to be together the next couple of weeks. Maybe you know my mother-she's Governor Jansen's secretary." The three shook their heads politely.<br><br> "Congratulations, by the way," he continued. "I watched all the episodes, just like everybody else. You were all brilliant!"<br><br> They smiled obligingly-just the cue the man needed to launch into his life story. He was studying law and loved politics and British rock bands. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br> Doggie thought he was nice and smelled good.<br><br> Bruce Jansen took one female prizewinner under each arm as they walked towards the welcoming deputation of photographers, cameramen, and journalists in Beijing's airport. The weather was cold and gray, and everyone was talking at once. After the obligatory questions from the Chinese press, the governor turned to face the international press that was standing behind a row of blue-clad Chinese soldiers.<br><br> Doggie quickly noticed one of the journalists, a very little man with intense, dark eyes and a receding hairline. A man who was obviously receiving more attention than the others and got all his questions answered, one after the other. When the interview was over, the governor and his wife disappeared in a black limousine, along with two Chinese officials. The rest of his staff followed in another official car, and the crowd of journalists began breaking up. Apparently the diminutive, dark-eyed journalist was the only one who seemed interested in the rest of Jansen's party. He waved to his photographer and made straight for the little group.<br><br> "Hey, my name's John Bugatti," he said with a hoarse voice, and cleared his throat. "I work for NBC. I'm supposed to follow along with you and Jansen on the whole tour, so I thought I'd say hello." Close up, Doggie could see he had more freckles than she'd ever seen. An irresistible little guy. She was really enjoying this trip-her father's objections had been completely unfounded.<br><br> Doggie Curtis's last day in Beijing began like a fairy tale, just like all the others. As usual, the little group of Americans had begun by eating breakfast in the hotel's dining room, surrounded by smiling waiters. Aside from Rosalie Lee and Caroll Jansen, whose finer motor functions seemed to be on the level of a stranded jellyfish, everyone was eating with chopsticks.<br><br> Doggie gazed through the large windows at the city's skyline with its scalelike tiled roofs on clusters of hutongs. They had wandered through the Summer Palace's enchanting, long corridors, breathed the air at Beihai Lake, and silently contemplated the calm that enveloped the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. The days had flown by, and now they were going to take a bus ride to the silk market, followed by a walk along the market's narrow streets to the nearby American consulate. That evening they were going to the circus, and the next day they would begin a trip around the Chinese countryside-Xi'an, the Yellow River, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and back again. It was a question of getting as much out of these remaining days as possible.<br><br> The market seemed remarkably quiet. Even the few curious people who were following along after the group were silent. None called out to them; no one was pushy.<br><br> "They sure do business in an orderly fashion here," whispered John Bugatti at Doggie's side. "You should see how they assault you in Hong Kong or Taipei. It'll probably be like that here in a couple of years, just wait and see."<br><br> She nodded and let her eyes wander over counters overflowing with bolts of material and multicolored silk dresses and scarves. One she saw would look perfect on her mother.<br><br> "What do you think that one costs? What's that say?" she asked Bugatti, pointing at a sign written in Chinese.<br><br> Suddenly, Caroll Jansen came out of nowhere and put her arm around Doggie's shoulder. "That one would look perfect on you!" She smiled, took out her wallet, gave the seller some money, and chose to ignore the fact that he didn't smile back as he folded up the scarf and handed it over the counter's rough planks.<br><br> "Come over here, Doggie!" called out Governor Jansen, who was standing before a large population of small Chinese figurines of an indeterminable material. "Look! This one brings good luck. May I have permission to give you one?"<br><br> The shopping took only a few more minutes and they were on their way towards the consulate, Doggie with a new scarf over her shoulder and a little, hollow Buddha figurine under her arm. She was proud and happy. Governor Jansen had looked her deep in the eyes and assured her that the little icon symbolized an eternal bond of friendship between them. "You just come to me if you ever need help," he said. It was amazing.<br><br> She hunched her shoulders and took a deep breath of the sharp morning air. Everything was perfect: her traveling companions, the exotic trees, and all the people going about their business. She smiled at the workers sitting on the edge of the sidewalk with chopsticks and small bowls, eating warm food from the stalls lined up behind them.<br><br> Wesley Barefoot was walking in front of her with a smile so broad, she could see it from behind.<br><br> He was pointing in all directions with one eye glued to a cheap, newly acquired camera. T. Perkins was walking along beside him, eyes alert, a plastic bag in each hand filled with all kinds of toys for nieces and nephews. At the head of the procession strode Governor Bruce Jansen in the best of moods with his wife under his arm. As they approached the consulate, he waved to one of the officials who was on his way across the street to greet them. Doggie looked up at the building. As she expected, it was smaller than the embassy on Xiushui Bei'jie where they'd eaten a delicious welcoming dinner two days before, but it still made a vivid, pompous impression in the sunshine, with the Stars and Stripes flapping in the breeze and an erect Chinese sentry standing on a low platform before the entry gate.<br><br> Doggie glanced over her shoulder, back down the crowded, narrow street of tradesmen and their stalls. There was a world of difference between the Western-style, official opulence of the consulate and the flimsy, thrown-together stalls of the silk market. It revealed a huge gulf in wealth and customs.<br><br> A little street seller was casting one of his many colorful dragon kites up into the breeze and the group paused to watch it wriggle towards the sky.<br><br> Then it happened.<br><br> Caroll Jansen suddenly screamed and struck out with both arms, her purse clutched in one hand. Doggie whirled around as her cry ended abruptly and she sank to the ground, blood squirting from her neck, while Governor Jansen's advisor, Thomas Sunderland, lunged after the young Chinese attacker. Sheriff T. Perkins flung away his plastic bags, so the sidewalk in front of the consulate came to life with bouncing rubber balls and small, plastic animals of every description, and in one leap he succeeded in cutting off the man's escape route back into the teaming silk market. Doggie would always remember the assailant's bloody knife, still gleaming as he tried to ward off the charging sheriff.<br><br> Next she saw Governor Jansen falling to his knees, the figure in his arms already lifeless. Her lips moved silently as people rushed from all directions to help. She saw everything: Rosalie Lee shredding her best blouse into strips to try and stem Caroll Jansen's bleeding, the soldiers racing over to T. Perkins, who, with blood running down his arm, had pinned the kicking, howling killer to the ground. And she saw Wesley Barefoot, standing still as a statue in the middle of everything, his face white as a corpse.</p><h2>A Puppy for Annie</h2><p>Annie loves her new puppy, Bess. But when Bess rattles her bowl or scratches the door, what is she trying to say? With her mother&#39;s help, Annie soon learns what Bess is telling her. But what will Bess do when her best friend leaves for school?</p><p>Kim Lewis is a Canadian-born artist, printmaker, author and illustrator. Her titles for children include Floss, Just Like Floss, Little Baa and Goodnight Harry, the first in a popular series about a cuddly toy elephant. Many of her picture books have been set in Northumberland where she lives with her family.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;A sweet story about a girl and her Border collie. When Annie brings Bess home, she wants to know what the puppy is trying to say. With Mom's gentle help, the child learns when Bess wants to be close to her, to be petted, and to play. The dog learns to come when called. The two friends love roaming the English countryside, exploring special places for hours. When the day comes that Annie must go to school, Bess misses her terribly. She halfheartedly plays with her toys and finally lies quietly at Mom's feet until she hears the school bus approach. Bess tears across the yard leaping and jumping to greet Annie, and the pair once again roam outdoors. The realistic, soft pastel and colored-pencil art reflects the joys of owning and loving a puppy. The story would work well in a storytime paired with Bob Graham's <i>"Let's Get a Pup!" Said Katie</i> (Candlewick, 2001) or when introducing children to pet ownership.

It is the pleasure of seeing revealed the humanity so often concealed in history." -Alfred Kazin </b> <br><br> Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to World War I. Though a man of the modern world, Adams remained in temperament a child of the 18th century, his political ideals shaped by his presidential ancestors, great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams. <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is both a brilliant memoir and a profound meditation on the extraordinary developments in science, politics, religion, and society that so transformed the world as he knew it. <br><br> For almost thirty years, The Library of America has presented America's best and most significant writing in acclaimed hardcover editions. Now, a new series, Library of America Paperback Classics, offers attractive and affordable books that bring The Library of America's authoritative texts within easy reach of every reader. Each book features an introductory essay by one of a leading writer, as well as a detailed chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the choice and history of the text, and notes. <br><br> The contents of this Paperback Classic are drawn from <i>Henry Adams: Novels, Mont Saint Michel, The Education,</i> volume number 14 in the Library of America series. That volume is joined in the series by two companion volumes, numbers 31 and 32, <i>Henry Adams: History of the United States During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson</i> and <i>Henry Adams: History of the United States During the Administrations of James Madison.</i></p><p>Many great artists have had at least intermittent doubts about their own abilities. But <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> is surely one of the few masterpieces to issue directly from a raging inferiority complex. The author, to be sure, had bigger shoes to fill than most of us. Both his grandfather and great-grandfather were U.S. presidents. His father, a relative underachiever, scraped by as a member of Congress and ambassador to the Court of St. James. But young Henry, born in Boston in 1838, was destined for a walk-on role in his nation's history--and seemed alarmingly aware of the fact from the time he was an adolescent.<p> It gets worse. For the author could neither match his exalted ancestors nor dismiss them as dusty relics--he was an Adams, after all, formed from the same 18th-century clay. "The atmosphere of education in which he lived was colonial," we are told, </p><blockquote>revolutionary, almost Cromwellian, as though he were steeped, from his greatest grandmother's birth, in the odor of political crime. Resistance to something was the law of New England nature; the boy looked out on the world with the instinct of resistance; for numberless generations his predecessors had viewed the world chiefly as a thing to be reformed, filled with evil forces to be abolished, and they saw no reason to suppose that they had wholly succeeded in the abolition; the duty was unchanged.</blockquote> Here, as always, Adams tells his story in a third-person voice that can seem almost extraplanetary in its detachment. Yet there's also an undercurrent of melancholy and amusement--and wonder at the specific details of what was already a lost world.<p> Continuing his uphill conquest of the learning curve, Adams attended Harvard, which didn't do much for him. ("The chief wonder of education is that it does not ruin everybody concerned in it, teachers and taught.") Then, after a beer-and-sausage-scented spell as a graduate student in Berlin, he followed his father to Washington, D.C., in 1860. There he might have remained--bogged down in "the same rude colony ... camped in the same forest, with the same unfinished Greek temples for workrooms, and sloughs for roads"--had not the Civil War sent Adams <i>p�re et fils</i> to London. Henry sat on the sidelines throughout the conflict, serving as his father's private secretary and anxiously negotiating the minefields of English society. He then returned home and commenced a long career as a journalist, historian, novelist, and peripheral participant in the political process--a kind of mouthpiece for what remained of the New England conscience.</p><p> He was not, by any measure but his own, a failure. And the proof of the pudding is <i>The Education of Henry Adams</i> itself, which remains among the oddest and most enlightening books in American literature. It contains thousands of memorable one-liners about politics, morality, culture, and transatlantic relations: "The American mind exasperated the European as a buzz-saw might exasperate a pine forest." There are astonishing glimpses of the high and mighty: "He saw a long, awkward figure; a plain, ploughed face; a mind, absent in part, and in part evidently worried by white kid gloves; features that expressed neither self-satisfaction nor any other familiar Americanism..." (That would be Abraham Lincoln; the "melancholy function" his Inaugural Ball.) But most of all, Adams's book is a brilliant account of how his own sensibility came to be. A literary landmark from the moment it first appeared, the <i>Autobiography</i> confers upon its author precisely that prize he felt had always eluded him: success. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>'I cannot remember when I was not fascinated by Henry Adams, ' said Gore Vidal. 'He was remarkably prescient about the coming horrors.' <br>His political ideals shaped by two presidential ancestors--great-grandfather John Adams and grandfather John Quincy Adams--Henry Adams was one of the most powerful and original minds to confront the American scene from the Civil War to the First World War. <br>Printed privately in 1907 and published to wide acclaim shortly after the author&amp;'s death in 1918, The Education of Henry Adams is a brilliant, idiosyncratic blend of autobiography and history that charts the great transformation in American life during the so-called Gilded Age. <br>With an introduction by renowned historian Edmund Morris.</p><h2>Women, Race and Class</h2><p>An in-depth study of women and race explores the complex relationship between racism and sexism, analyzes the role of women and race, and traces the historical connection between sexism, racism, and class consciousness</p><p>Longtime activist, author and political figure Angela Davis brings us this expose of the women&#39;s movement in the context of the fight for civil rights and working class issues. She uncovers a side of the fight for suffrage many of us have not heard: the intimate tie between the anti-slavery campaign and the struggle for women&#39;s suffrage. She shows how the racist and classist bias of some in the women&#39;s movement have divided its own membership. Davis&#39; message is clear: If we ever want equality, we&#39;re gonna have to fight for it together.&#34;As useful an exposition of the current dilemmas of the women&#39;s movement as one could hope for.&#34;--Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>Roissy Express: A Journey Through the Paris Suburbs</h2><p>Accompanied by photographer Anaik Frantz, Francois Maspero embarked on a journey along the RER, the express subway which leads through the Paris suburbs. Getting off the train at each stop, he and Frantz present a picture of daily life in France which tourists seldom see: a world where names don&#x2019;t make sense, where immigrants from Burkino Faso live in run-down tower-blocks called Debussy on the avenue Karl Marx, their children dodging the police between the lycee Jules Valles and the Yuri Gagarin youth-club; a world where there are still memories of the Commune, the Popular Front or the camp at Drancy from where French officials sent a hundred thousand Jews to Auschwitz; a world where no one is a racist, but National Front posters are everywhere. Maspero&#x2019;s aim is to put this world back on the map.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchAnyone who has ever attempted to create something positive from nothing or write something about nothingness will understand and appreciate the amount of time and effort that went into this tedious undertaking. In 1989, two Parisians decided to take the Roissy Express, a commuter train, to the Paris suburbs and explore life along each stop. This is their narrative-a documentary written in diary format. They write of towns without pasts, places without futures, relics without people, ghost towns, a concentration camp way station, people, farms, desolation, poverty, hopelessness. This is not a travel guide for Americans or other foreign tourists but a sociological history and commentary of and for Parisians and French suburbanites.

He was very weak. He had not eaten for seventy-two hours, or taken water for forty-eight.<br><br>Not weak. He was dying, and he knew it.<br><br>The images in his mind showed things drifting away. A rowboat caught in a river current, straining against a rotted rope, pulling, tugging, breaking free. His viewpoint was that of a small boy in the boat, sitting low, staring back helplessly at the bank as the dock grew smaller.<br><br>Or an airship swinging gently on a breeze, somehow breaking free of its mast, floating up and away, slowly, the boy inside seeing tiny urgent figures on the ground, waving, staring, their faces tilted upward in concern.<br><br>Then the images faded, because now words seemed more important than pictures, which was absurd, because he had never been interested in words before. But before he died he wanted to know which words were his. Which applied to him? Was he a man or a boy? He had been described both ways. <i>Be a man</i>, some had said. Others had been insistent: <i>The boy's not to blame</i>. He was old enough to vote and kill and die, which made him a man. He was too young to drink, even beer, which made him a boy. Was he brave, or a coward? He had been called both things. He had been called <i>unhinged, disturbed, deranged, unbalanced, delusional, traumatized</i>, all of which he understood and accepted, except <i>unhinged</i>. Was he supposed to be <i>hinged</i>? Like a door? Maybe people were doors. Maybe things passed through them. Maybe they banged in the wind. He considered the question for a long moment and then he batted the air in frustration. He was babbling like a teenager in love with weed.<br><br>Which is exactly all he had been, a year and a half before.<br><br>He fell to his knees. The sand was only half as hot as he had known sand to be, but it was hot enough to ease his chill. He fell facedown, exhausted, finally spent. He knew as certainly as he had ever known anything that if he closed his eyes he would never open them again.<br><br>But he was very tired.<br><br>So very, very tired.<br><br>More tired than a man or a boy had ever been.<br><br>He closed his eyes.<br><br><i>2</i><br>The line between Hope and Despair was exactly that: a line, in the road, formed where one town's blacktop finished and the other's started. Hope's highway department had used thick dark asphalt rolled smooth. Despair had a smaller municipal budget. That was clear. They had top-dressed a lumpy roadbed with hot tar and dumped gray gravel on it. Where the two surfaces met there was an inch-wide trench of no-man's-land filled with a black rubbery compound. An expansion joint. A boundary. A line. Jack Reacher stepped over it midstride and kept on walking. He paid it no attention at all.<br><br>But he remembered it later. Later, he was able to recall it in great detail.<br><br>Hope and Despair were both in Colorado. Reacher was in Colorado because two days previously he had been in Kansas, and Colorado was next to Kansas. He was making his way west and south. He had been in Calais, Maine, and had taken it into his head to cross the continent diagonally, all the way to San Diego in California. Calais was the last major place in the Northeast, San Diego was the last major place in the Southwest. One extreme to the other. The Atlantic to the Pacific, cool and damp to hot and dry. He took buses where there were any and hitched rides where there weren't. Where he couldn't find rides, he walked. He had arrived in Hope in the front passenger seat of a bottle-green Mercury Grand Marquis driven by a retired button salesman. He was on his way out of Hope on foot because that morning there had been no traffic heading west toward Despair.<br><br>He remembered that fact later, too. And wondered why he hadn't wondered why.<br><br>In terms of his grand diagonal design, he was slightly off course. Ideally he should have been angling directly southwest into New Mexico. But he wasn't a stickler for plans, and the Grand Marquis had been a comfortable car, and the old guy had been fixed on Hope because he had three grandchildren to see there, before heading onward to Denver to see four more. Reacher had listened patiently to the old guy's family tales and had figured that a saw-tooth itinerary first west and then south was entirely acceptable. Maybe two sides of a triangle would be more entertaining than one. And then in Hope he had looked at a map and seen Despair seventeen miles farther west and had been unable to resist the detour. Once or twice in his life he had made the same trip metaphorically. Now he figured he should make it for real, since the opportunity was right there in front of him.<br><br>He remembered that whim later, too.<br><br>The road between the two towns was a straight two-lane. It rose very gently as it headed west. Nothing dramatic. The part of eastern Colorado that Reacher was in was pretty flat. Like Kansas. But the Rockies were visible up ahead, blue and massive and hazy. They looked very close. Then suddenly they didn't. Reacher breasted a slight rise and stopped dead and understood why one town was called Hope and the other Despair. Settlers and homesteaders struggling west a hundred and fifty years before him would have stopped over in what came to be called Hope and would have seen their last great obstacle seemingly within touching distance. Then after a day's or a week's or a month's repose they would have moved on again and breasted the same slight rise and seen that the Rockies' apparent proximity had been nothing more than a cruel trick of topography. An optical illusion. A trick of the light. From the top of the rise the great barrier seemed once again remote, even unreachably distant, across hundreds more miles of endless plains. Maybe thousands more miles, although that too was an illusion. Reacher figured that in truth the first significant peaks were about two hundred miles away. A long month's hard trekking on foot and in mule-drawn carts, across featureless wilderness and along occasional decades-old wheel ruts. Maybe six weeks' hard trekking, in the wrong season. In context, not a disaster, but certainly a bitter disappointment, a blow hard enough to drive the anxious and the impatient from hope to despair in the time between one glance at the horizon and the next.<br><br>Reacher stepped off Despair's gritty road and walked through crusted sandy earth to a table rock the size of a car. He levered himself up and lay down with his hands behind his head and stared up at the sky. It was pale blue and laced with long high feathery clouds that might once have been vapor trails from coast-to-coast red-eye planes. Back when he smoked he might have lit a cigarette to pass the time. But he didn't smoke anymore. Smoking implied carrying at least a pack and a book of matches, and Reacher had long ago quit carrying things he didn't need. There was nothing in his pockets except paper money and an expired passport and an ATM card and a clip-together toothbrush. There was nothing waiting for him anywhere else, either. No storage unit in a distant city, nothing stashed with friends. He owned the things in his pockets and the clothes on his back and the shoes on his feet. That was all, and that was enough. Everything he needed, and nothing he didn't.<br><br>He got to his feet and stood on tiptoe, high on the rock. Behind him to the east was a shallow bowl maybe ten miles in diameter with the town of Hope roughly in its center, eight or nine miles back, maybe ten blocks by six of brick-built buildings and an outlying clutter of houses and farms and barns and other structures made of wood and corrugated metal. Together they made a warm low smudge in the haze. Ahead of him to the west were tens of thousands of flat square miles, completely empty except for ribbons of distant roads and the town of Despair about eight or nine miles ahead. Despair was harder to see than Hope. The haze was thicker in the west. The place looked larger than Hope had been, and teardrop-shaped, with a conventional plains downtown mostly south of the main drag and then a wider zone of activity beyond it, maybe industrial in nature, hence the smog. Despair looked less pleasant than Hope. Cold, where Hope had looked warm; gray, where Hope had been mellow. It looked unwelcoming. For a brief moment Reacher considered backtracking and striking out south from Hope itself, getting back on course, but he dismissed the thought even before it had fully formed. Reacher hated turning back. He liked to press on, dead ahead, whatever. Everyone's life needed an organizing principle, and relentless forward motion was Reacher's.<br><br>He was angry at himself later, for being so inflexible.<br><br>He climbed off the rock and rejoined the road twenty yards west of where he had left it. He stepped up onto the left-hand edge and continued walking, long strides, an easy pace, a little faster than three miles an hour, facing oncoming traffic, the safest way. But there was no oncoming traffic. No traffic in either direction. The road was deserted. No vehicles were using it. No cars, no trucks. Nothing. No chance of a ride. Reacher was a little puzzled, but mostly unconcerned. Many times in his life he had walked a lot more than seventeen miles at a stretch. He raked the hair off his forehead and pulled his shirt loose on his shoulders and kept on going, toward whatever lay ahead.<br><br><i>3</i><br>Despair's downtown area began with a vacant lot where something had been planned maybe twenty years before but never built. Then came an old motor court, shuttered, maybe permanently abandoned. Across the street and fifty yards west was a gas station. Two pumps, both of them old. Not the kind of upright rural antiques Reacher had seen in Edward Hopper's paintings, but still a couple of generations off the pace. There was a small hut in back with a grimy window full of quarts of oil arrayed in a pyramid. Reacher crossed the apron and stuck his head in the door. It was dark inside the hut and the air smelled of creosote and hot raw wood. There was a guy behind a counter, in worn blue overalls stained black with dirt. He was about thirty, and lean.<br><br>"Got coffee?" Reacher asked him.<br><br>"This is a gas station," the guy said.<br><br>"Gas stations sell coffee," Reacher said. "And water, and soda."<br><br>"Not this one," the guy said. "We sell gas."<br><br>"And oil."<br><br>"If you want it."<br><br>"Is there a coffee shop in town?"<br><br>"There's a restaurant."<br><br>"Just one?"<br><br>"One is all we need."<br><br>Reacher ducked back out to the daylight and kept on walking. A hundred yards farther west the road grew sidewalks and according to a sign on a pole changed its name to Main Street. Thirty feet later came the first developed block. It was occupied by a dour brick cube, three stories high, on the left side of the street, to the south. It might once have been a dry goods emporium. It was still some kind of a retail enterprise. Reacher could see three customers and bolts of cloth and plastic household items through its dusty groundfloor windows. Next to it was an identical three-story brick cube, and then another, and another. The downtown area seemed to be about twelve blocks square, bulked mostly to the south of Main Street. Reacher was no kind of an architectural expert, and he knew he was way west of the Mississippi, but the whole place gave him the feel of an old Connecticut factory town, or the Cincinnati riverfront. It was plain, and severe, and unadorned, and out of date. He had seen movies about small-town America in which the sets had been artfully dressed to look a little more perfect and vibrant than reality. This place was the exact opposite. It looked like a designer and a whole team of grips had worked hard to make it dowdier and gloomier than it needed to be. Traffic on the streets was light. Sedans and pick-up trucks were moving slow and lazy. None of them was newer than three years old. There were few pedestrians on the sidewalks.<br><br>Reacher made a random left turn and set about finding the promised restaurant. He quartered a dozen blocks and passed a grocery store and a barber shop and a bar and a rooming house and a faded old hotel before he found the eatery. It took up the whole ground floor of another dull brick cube. The ceiling was high and the windows were floor-to-ceiling plate glass items filling most of the walls. The place might have been an automobile showroom in the past. The floor was tiled and the tables and chairs were plain brown wood and the air smelled of boiled vegetables. There was a register station inside the door with a <i>Please Wait to Be Seated</i> sign on a short brassed pole with a heavy base. Same sign he had seen everywhere, coast to coast. Same script, same colors, same shape. He figured there was a catering supply company somewhere turning them out by the millions. He had seen identical signs in Calais, Maine, and expected to see more in San Diego, California. He stood next to the register and waited.<br><br>And waited.<br><br>There were eleven customers eating. Three couples, a threesome, and two singletons. One waitress. No front-of-house staff. Nobody at the register. Not an unusual ratio. Reacher had eaten in a thousand similar places and he knew the rhythm, subliminally. The lone waitress would soon glance over at him and nod, as if to say <i>I'll be right with you</i>. Then she would take an order, deliver a plate, and scoot over, maybe blowing an errant strand of hair off her cheek in a gesture designed to be both an apology and an appeal for sympathy. She would collect a menu from a stack and lead him to a table and bustle away and then revisit him in strict sequence.<br><br>But she didn't do any of that.<br><br>She glanced over. Didn't nod. Just looked at him for a long second and then looked away. Carried on with what she was doing. Which by that point wasn't much. She had all her eleven customers pacified. She was just making work. She was stopping by tables and asking if everything was all right and refilling coffee cups that were less than an inch down from the rim. Reacher turned and checked the door glass to see if he had missed an opening-hours sign. To see if the place was about to close up. It wasn't. He checked his reflection, to see if he was committing a social outrage with the way he was dressed. He wasn't. He was wearing dark gray pants and a matching dark gray shirt, both bought two days before in a janitorial surplus store in Kansas. Janitorial supply stores were his latest discovery. Plain, strong, well-made clothing at reasonable prices. Perfect. His hair was short and tidy. He had shaved the previous morning. His fly was zipped.</p><h2>The Fourth Century</h2><p><i>The Fourth Century</i> tells of the quest by young Mathieu B�luse to discover the lost history of his country, Martinique. Aware that the officially recorded version he learned in school omits and distorts, he turns to a <i>quimboiseur</i> named Papa Longou�. This old man of the forest, a healer, seer, and storyteller, knows the oral tradition and its relation to the powers of the land and the forces of nature. He tells of the love-hate relationship between the Longou� and B�luse families, whose ancestors were brought as slaves to Martinique. Upon arrival, Longou� immediately escaped and went to live in the hills as a maroon. B�luse remained in slavery. The intense relationship that had formed between the two men in Africa continued and came to encompass the relations between their masters, or, in the case of Longou�, his would-be master, and their descendants. <i>The Fourth Century</i> closes the gap between the families as Papa Longou�, last of his line, conveys the history to Mathieu B�luse, who becomes his heir.</p><p>�douard Glissant is one of the foundational figures of Francophone literature. Along with other writers from the French West Indies, he inaugurated a radical interrogation of the French literary canon from the margins of the traditionally Paris-centered literary world.

With <i>A Painted House</i>, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes "not a single lawyer, dead or alive," and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and "hill people" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: "I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice."<p> What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat in <i>A Painted House</i> to the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor: </p><blockquote> I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it. </blockquote> Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. But <i>A Painted House</i> suggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight. <i>--James Marcus</i>Dear Friends: <p><i>A Painted House</i> is not a legal thriller. In fact, there is not a single lawyer, dead or alive, in this story. Nor are there judges, trials, courtrooms, conspiracies or nagging social issues. </p><p><i>A Painted House</i> is a work of fiction. It was inspired by my childhood in rural Arkansas. The setting is reasonably accurate, though historical accuracy should not be taken too seriously. One or two of these characters may actually have lived and breathed on this earth, though I know them only through family lore, which in my family is a most unreliable source. One or two of these events may indeed have taken place, though I've heard so many different versions of these events that I believe none of them myself. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>John Grisham</p></p><h2>Astronomy (Discovery Program / Internet Linked)</h2><p>Introduces concepts and provides basic information on formal and backyard astronomy, with simplified star maps for both hemispheres.</p><p></p><h2>Gourmet&#39;s Old Vienna Cookbook: A Viennese Memoir</h2><p>Shares recipes for traditional Viennese-style appetizers, soups, seafood, meat, poultry, game dishes, vegetables, dumplings, noodle dishes, salads, sauces, breads, pastries, and desserts</p><p></p><h2>We Love to Sew: 28 Pretty Things to Make: Jewelry, Headbands, Softies, T-shirts, Pillows, Bags &amp; More</h2><p>This title features 30 whimsical projects - from jewellery and bags to room decor - created especially for girls 8 &amp; up to wear, use, and give.

They both reside in the Philadelphia area and conduct cooking classes and demonstrations in and around the city.Although Smith and Hazan (coauthors of The Original Philadelphia Neighborhood Cookbook ) ladle up some serviceable recipes, this work remains ordinary because it reveals little of Baltimore's unique character. Each recipe is identified with an area of the city--for example, baked winter squash comes from ``Cross Street Market, Federal Hill''--but such notes will make sense only to readers already familiar with the city. As for the dishes themselves, many, such as oxtail stew and chicken pie with sour cream pastry, make satisfying family meals, while others, like veal Marsala and lobster and crab Benjamin, are fancy enough for parties. And some, like Brazilian baked shrimp with coconut sauce, German hot cabbage salad and two versions of bul-go-gi (Korean barbecued beef), hint at the city's cultural diversity. But a few offerings, such as meatloaf surprise (the ``surprise'' is cheddar cheese) and a chicken with rice made with canned soups, are so commonplace that it is difficult to see why they're included.

In that spirit, <i>A New Literary History of Modern China </i>looks beyond state-sanctioned works and official narratives to reveal China as it has seldom been seen before, through a rich spectrum of writings covering Chinese literature from the late-seventeenth century to the present.</p><p>Featuring over 140 Chinese and non-Chinese contributors from throughout the world, this landmark volume explores unconventional forms as well as traditional genres&#x2015;pop song lyrics and presidential speeches, political treatises and prison-house jottings, to name just a few. Major figures such as Lu Xun, Shen Congwen, Eileen Chang, and Mo Yan appear in a new light, while lesser-known works illuminate turning points in recent history with unexpected clarity and force. Many essays emphasize Chinese authors&#x2019; influence on foreign writers as well as China&#x2019;s receptivity to outside literary influences. Contemporary works that engage with ethnic minorities and environmental issues take their place in the critical discussion, alongside writers who embraced Chinese traditions and others who resisted.

The publication of this book, with its range and breadth of scholarship, is an event without precedent in the field of modern Chinese literary studies. Some of the essays read like polished vignettes while some are whimsical, others build swiftly to a punchy thesis, and others again offer distilled wisdom on a crucial topic.

Editor David Der-wei Wang, a professor of Chinese and comparative literature at Harvard, offers 161 short and often sparkling essays by a multinational array of writers and academics in what seems the most exhaustive introduction to modern Chinese writing possible in a single volume.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Neville-Hadley</b><b>, </b><b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;One hundred and forty-three authors contributed 161 short chapters to this monumental survey of modern Chinese literature in all its forms, from the late eighteenth century to the present. Yet the book reads like the work of a single versatile author: vivid, probing, and occasionally playful. It raises to a new level the knowledge available in English about this vast topic, presenting a literary culture more complex, cosmopolitan, and profound than even many specialists might realize. The book presents a wealth of detail about personalities and events throughout the Chinese-speaking world and connects them to cultural forms ranging from poetry, fiction, and opera to pop songs, cartoons, photographs, and film. It challenges much of the received wisdom about how literary history should be written, refutes the clich� that Chinese literature in the modern and contemporary periods has been derivative and mediocre, and opens up inspiring prospects for future scholarship.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Andrew J.

It is a work that speaks to the resilience of the human spirit from a perspective rarely found in literature.</p>Armistead Maupin was born in Washington, D.C. in 1944 but was brought up in Raleigh, North Carolina. A graduate of the University of North Carolina, he served as a naval officer in Vietnam before moving to California in 1971 as a reporter for the Associated Press. In 1976 he launched his daily newspaper serial, Tales of the City, in the San Francisco Chronicle.

And there is certainly nothing more integral to the development of the modern world. In <i>The Sea: A Cultural History</i>, John Mack considers those great expanses that both unite and divide us, and the ways in which human beings interact because of the sea, from navigation to colonization to trade. Much of the world&#x2019;s population lives on or near the cost, and as Mack explains, in a variety of ways, people actually&nbsp;inhabit the sea.</p><p><i>The Sea </i>looks at the characteristics of different seas and oceans and investigates how the sea is conceptualized in various cultures. Mack explores the diversity of maritime technologies, especially the practice of navigation and the creation of a society of the sea, which in many cultures is all-male, often cosmopolitan, and always hierarchical. He describes the cultures and the social and technical practices characteristic of seafarers, as well as their distinctive language and customs. As he shows, the separation of sea and land is evident in the use of different vocabularies on land and on sea for the same things, the change in a mariner&#x2019;s behavior when on land, and in the liminal status of points uniting the two realms, like beaches and ports. Mack also explains how ships are deployed in symbolic contexts on land in ecclesiastical and public architecture. Yet despite their differences, the two realms are always in dialogue in symbolic and economic terms.</p><p>Casting a wide net, <i>The Sea</i> uses histories, maritime archaeology, biography, art history, and literature to provide an innovative and experiential account of the waters that define our worldly existence. </p></p><p><p><b>John Mack</b> is professor of world art studies at the University of East Anglia. He is also the author of <i>Museum of the Mind: Art and Memory in World Cultures </i>and <i>The Art of Small Things</i>. <b></b></p><p>&#x201c;This is the book that I have been waiting for&#x2014;an anthropologist&#x2019;s exploration of man's engagement with the sea. In this brilliant analysis John Mack shows us that innate inquisitiveness has driven humans to challenge the sea creating one of the great dynamics energizing the human story. <i>The Sea</i> is essential reading for all with an interest in the remarkable story of humankind.&#x201d;&#x2014;Barry Cunliffe</p> (Barry Cunliffe)<br><br><p>"'I am a part of the sea and the sea is part of me,' muses a Torres Straits elder, and John Mack brings readers to just such recognition of their own places in the world. In his able hands, seas become places and not merely The Great Between. They have their own histories, and demand sophisticated technologies of exploration, exploitation, and intellectual fathoming. Through many years of museum scholarship, Mack has perfected a grand, sweeping vision matched by delight in deepest detail, and here he tells compelling stories about 'ships as societies,' 'sea gypsies,' and the hundred named 'seamarks' in open water known to residents of Mabuiag Island.

As well as an international bestselling author, he is a businessman, meditation teacher and director of a medical research foundation. Paul is known as the 'guru of calm'. He has created a string of bestsellers on the topic of calm - ranging from his introduction to meditation, The Calm Technique, to Instant Calm and Calm at Work, through to the book that inspired the 'little book' phenomenon that swept the world, The Little Book of Calm.

Vermont author Thom Hartman offers a highly persuasive argument for adopting the spiritual values of our ancient ancestors, which means living with a strong connection to the earth as well as the sun that nourishes us all. Nowadays, humans often perceive themselves as separate from nature and born to dominate it, says Hartman who lays out some frightening, albeit thorough, research on the destruction of the planet. But as the book progresses, he guides readers into a convincing and intelligent vision for reversing our destructive ways.<p> Mostly, we could all use an attitude adjustment. For example, he explains how native and tribal cultures often considered all forms of life to be as sacred as human life--an attitude that may be one of our best shots at planetary longevity. Hartman devotes his final section to "What the Average Person Can Do," including chapters titled, "Turn Off the TV," "The Modern-Day Tribe: Intentional Community," and "Reinventing Our Daily Lives and Rituals." <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>The Mythical Books version of Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight was written in 1996-97 for 1998 publication, so I was very pleased when Harmony Books picked it up for August 1999 publication and encouraged me to go through the book to update it. We finished the process in June, so it&#39;s about as up-to-date as we could be! There are also many things I&#39;ve added to the text, reflecting new thinking, learning, and facts. And, we&#39;ve added a very comprehensive index. All in all, this is a vastly improved book over the original trade version. Enjoy!

Two U.S. citizens, Robert Semple and Thomas Larkin, bought the land from Mexican Army General Mariano Vallejo for $100 and the promise to name it for Vallejo&#x2019;s wife in 1847. The next year a customer at Von Pfister&#x2019;s Benicia waterfront store let slip the secret of the gold discovery at Sutter&#x2019;s Mill. Benicia&#x2019;s deep water harbor attracted Pacific Mail and Steamship Company, the first major California industry, the famous Matthew Turner shipyards, tanneries, and the Central Pacific Railroad, which made Benicia its transcontinental terminus. State legislators made the town their third state capital in 1853.<br>That oldest surviving capitol building still stands along with many historic buildings, including the stately structures of a U.S. military base that began with the Benicia Barracks in 1849 and continued to serve until 1964.</p><p>This delightful visual voyage through time has been assembled largely from the fine photographic collection of the Benicia Historical Museum by its knowledgeable staff.

As experience overtakes innocence, Andrea gradually learns the disquieting truth about the people she shares her life with: her overbearing and superstitious aunt Angustias; her nihilistic yet artistically gifted uncle Rom�n and his violent brother Juan; and Juan&#x2019;s disturbingly beautiful wife, Gloria, who secretly supports the clan with her gambling. From existential crisis to a growing maturity and resolve, Andrea&#x2019;s passionate inner journey leaves her wiser, stronger, and filled with hope for the future. <br><br>The incomparable Edith Grossman&#x2019;s vital new translation captures the feverish energy of Laforet&#x2019;s magnificent story, showcasing its dark, powerful imagery, and its subtle humor.

Yet many childcare experts reckon these crimes are just the tip of an iceberg of wide scale exploitation occurring across the country.

Herman Melville and Walt Whitman were 27, Lincoln was 37. The first telegraph lines were up and humming. California was still part of Mexico, but already faint parallel lines&#x2014;wheel tracks left by emigrant wagon trains&#x2014;marked the California Trail. Close to half a million emigrants would cross the plains before completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, but in July, 1846, there were only 800 Americans in California, and the routes across the Continental Divide and the Sierra Nevada were not yet well established. It was on the 20th of that month that the Donner Party set out for California from Little Sandy Creek, Wyoming&#x2014;enough time, they thought, to cross the Sierras before the winter snows fell. <p>Eighty-seven men, women and children set out on the journey, and their tragic fate constitutes one of the most gripping and chilling chapters in the exploration and settlement of the American West. Much has been written over the years about the Donner Party&#x2014;and a powerful documentary film, Simple Justice, was made by Ric Burns in 1993 and shown on PBS&#x2014;but George Stewart&#x2019;s spell-binding and compassionate narrative, Ordeal by Hunger, published initially in 1936, remains the gold standard. In his introduction to our edition, James D. Houston writes: "Sixty-five years after its first publication, this remarkable narrative still stands as the definitive account, giving dramatic life to a haunting and emblematic tale." </p><p>Though there is horror and tragedy in this story, there are also acts of courage and selflessness. It is a powerful human drama. As the author puts it, the story tells "what human beings may achieve, endure, and perpetrate in the final press of circumstance." </p><p>In addition to James Houston&#x2019;s authoritative, new introduction, we have incorporated new illustrations and maps, aided in this effort by many organizations, most especially The Bancroft Library of The University of California, Berkeley.</p></p><p>GEORGE R.

When they were trapped by early snow in the Sierra Nevadas, they turned to cannibalism to stay alive. Expertly read by Jeff Riggenbach, the tale retains its freshness and power 150 years later.

She is inspired by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who always believed in her writing and never gave up. She and her husband live in Mexico.Kindergarten-Grade 4-This inviting picture book covers the childhood, courtship, and mature years of Anna Mary Robertson, the self-taught artist whose cheerful, upstate-New York landscapes and scenes of family gatherings first garnered serious attention as she turned 80. Robertson's experience with and exposure to creative endeavors throughout the years are woven naturally into the narrative: she built "air-castles" (played make-believe), designed homemade paper dolls, watched her father paint "landscapes" on their living room walls, and, as an adult, painted an outdoor scene on her parlor wall. An author's note puts the artist's life in perspective, historically, and a bibliography highlights the source of the text's quotes. Wallner's folksy illustrations depicting both the chores and the glory of farm life serve her subject well. This work complements W. Nikola-Lisa's The Year with Grandma Moses (Holt, 2000), a title that presents Robertson through her own voice and art, but is more circumscribed in its coverage. Grandma Moses is sure to be appreciated during units focused on the accomplishments of women, artists, or octogenarians.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Great earthwork barriers survive, along with the remains of forts and temporary camps; watch-towers and fortified gates; civilian settlements, temples, cemeteries, bath-houses, roads and bridges. Stretching across the spine of England from the North-East coast to the Irish Sea, the line of the frontier extends for over 100 miles through every type of landscape: from the streets of urban Tyneside, through arable fields; along the crags of the wild Whin Sill; to the sands of the Solway, and down the coast of Cumbria. Drawing upon the extensive expertise and unrivalled archives of English Heritage, and those of its partners, this map depicts the fruits of modern archaeological research: in field survey, geophysics, excavation, and the analysis of aerial photographs. Using Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 data - the ideal scale for walkers - this revised new map shows with great clarity all the elements of Hadrian&#39;s Wall, and distinguishes between those features that are visible and those that have been levelled through time. A brief text explains the remains on the ground, and how to use the map to find them - including the museums and the best places to visit.

Seen from afar, her crystalline world was an awesome bauble glimmering in the vastness of space. From within, it was a forest of massive monoliths, dancing light beams, and perpetual shadow. </p><p> Not only was Melora's body suspended in midair, which was normal, but her mind felt as if it were suspended, too. She was reminded of the out-of-body experiences humans often claimed to have had, even though few of them ever took the time to understand such phenomena. </p><p> It wasn't surprising that the Lipuls' dreamships had first contacted humans, out of all the Federation species. Unlike Elaysians, humans were open-minded, even generous and outgoing. But like Elaysians, they could also be obstinate and blunt. That bluntness was now being amply demonstrated by the harsh words of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, as he lectured Tangre Bertoran and a handful of Elaysian engineers. </p><p> In standard Federation language, the captain had already told them they had the equivalent of eight days to live. Did her fellow Elaysians even know how short a time period that was? They didn't have <i>days</i> on Gemworld, in the accepted sense, only refracted sunlight and a strange sort of twilight in the shadows. Gemworld had been inhabited ever since the universe was young, and they thought they had surmounted every obstacle. How could her people possibly comprehend that their life expectancy had come down to eight rotations of a faraway alien planet? </p><p> She could tell by the concern on Reg Barclay's face that he understood their predicament -- and the truth of Picard's dire prediction. Counselor Deanna Troi listened with her usual detachment as the captain finished his summation. </p><p> "That is quite impossible, Captain," said Tangre Bertoran, in a tone of voice usually reserved for small children who have told grandiose lies. The silver-haired Peer of the Jeptah shook his head in pity. "Thoron radiation is naturally occurring in our atmosphere. And in Earth's too, I understand. It couldn't harm all life on Gemworld, only those who spend too much time near the mutant crystal." </p><p> "Which continues to grow every day," insisted the captain. "Commander Data is not given to making errant predictions. Trust me when I say that we have to shut down the darkmatter collectors and the dimensional rift in eight days -- by whatever means -- or we'll all die. If we have to shut down the shell to accomplish that goal, then so be it." </p><p> Bertoran wrinkled his nose and forehead ridges as if sniffing a foul odor. "Captain, we don't talk about 'shutting down the shell,' even in jest....That is like saying we need to destroy the Earth in order to stop a weed from growing. Yes, it will work -- but at what cost?" </p><p> The captain gestured broadly, making it clear how frustrated he felt. "I don't want <i>anyone</i> to die, especially not two billion inhabitants. My first officer and chief engineer think that we can power your forcefields from the <i>Enterprise</i> for a brief period, taking over while the shell is turned off. You know how all those systems are intertwined -- there's no other choice. If we're successful, Gemworld won't lose any of her atmosphere." </p><p> "And if you're wrong, we'll all be dead," replied Bertoran snidely. </p><p> "We have eight days to put something together," answered Picard, sounding as if that were plenty of time. "We have considerable experience with forcefields, and my people have already gotten a head start on this. Your people can help by making sealed shelters, bottling air -- whatever is necessary. Believe me, I wouldn't suggest this course if I didn't think we could do it." </p><p> Tangre Bertoran grimaced his displeasure. "What you're asking goes against all my upbringing and common sense. It's akin to <i>murder.</i> I don't know, Captain...I need to see Commander Data's sensor readings before I agree to this." </p><p> "We've got them." Picard gestured, and Reg Barclay fumbled in a pouch on his belt, finally producing an isolinear chip. Melora smiled at the contrast between this gleaming storage device and the aged violet prism that hung from Reg's neck. </p><p> "Can you read isolinear chips?" asked the captain. </p><p> Bertoran sneered. "After we joined the Federation, it took us about two weeks to master your language and technology. Now you wish to destroy <i>ours</i> in a heartbeat." </p><p> "Your technology has turned against you," said Deanna Troi, speaking up for the first time since the meeting began. Hesitantly, the counselor floated down from the circular doorway, looking uneasy in her weightless state. "We wouldn't go to this much trouble to destroy you. The only thing that can destroy you is doing nothing." </p><p> Tangre Bertoran scowled and snatched the isolinear chip from Reg's hand. "Give me a moment." </p><p> He and his entourage retreated to a monitoring console, where they plugged in the chip and studied the data, muttering in low tones. Melora hovered overhead, uncertain whether she should join her fellow Elaysians or stay with her unfamiliar crew. Since coming back to Gemworld, she had felt increasingly torn between her duty to Starfleet and a natural inclination to protect her people and her homeworld. The two shouldn't be mutually exclusive, but Starfleet represented the whole Federation, not just one peculiar planet. </p><p> Her split allegiance had never been an issue before, because Gemworld had always seemed like a memory from a past life, something that would never intrude on her Starfleet commitments. But being here, visiting her old enclave, seeing the frightened faces and the crumbling, mutant crystal -- it had become clear that Gemworld needed her more than Starfleet did. </p><p> For now, the dimensional rift not only threatened their solar system, but it could endanger the entire quadrant if left unchecked. Captain Picard had made it clear that he would sacrifice his ship and every soul on her planet to keep that from happening. And he probably wouldn't hesitate to use the <i>Enterprise's</i> weapon systems. </p><p> Reg Barclay looked at Melora and smiled sweetly, jarring her out of her depressing reverie. His boyish, earnest face brought out a smile in her, and she realized how glad she was to see him again. Here she was -- perhaps in the last days of her life -- and she had met a perfectly charming man who doted on her and strove to protect her. In fact, he strove to protect <i>all</i> of her people, as proven by the shard around his neck. </p><p> He was an unlikely hero -- and an even more unlikely acting senior engineer for the Elaysians -- yet he performed both duties valiantly. Looking at Reg brought out a respect and affection in Melora that she had thought she could never feel for anyone. And her feelings were amplified by the guilt she felt over not being totally honest with him....The last thing she wanted to do was to hurt Reg, or any member of the <i>Enterprise</i> crew. They were trying to help, but they didn't fully understand. </p><p> Did Reg know how she felt about him? Did it even matter -- with all the obstacles they faced? </p><p> <i>Yes, it matters,</i> decided Melora. This should be a time to feel for one another -- to seek love, and give it. What did it mean to fight for life if</p></p><h2>Commercial Insurance / Second Edition</h2><p>Malvern, PA: American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, 2007 (publication date 2008).

Composed in only a few short weeks, it contains the essence of the basic teachings of all religions. For the individual seeking to know more about their own self and the riddle of existence, it is a modern-day book of instructions. It describes in detail the way of life essential for real spiritual development and the obstacles that stand in the way of the proper evolution of the race. The book presents a view of the enlightened society of the future and the true destiny of mankind in this well-planned creation.</p><p>Gopi Krishna was born in 1903, near the city of Srinagar, in the Jammu and Kashmir State in northern India. He spent his earlier years there and later, in Lahore, in the Punjab of British India. At the age of twenty, he returned to Kashmir and during the succeeding years he secured a post in the state government, married and raised a family. Later in his career, he became the leader of a social organization that was devoted to helping the disadvantaged in his community. <p>At the age of 34, while meditating one morning, he experienced the sudden and forceful awakening of Kundalini, which he described in full detail years later in his autobiography, KundaliniThe Evolutionary Energy in Man. From that day, till the end of his life, the energy was fully active in his body and eventually brought about a radical, permanent transformation of his perceptive faculties. </p><p>Gopi Krishnas last 25 years were devoted to bringing the attention of the world to this phenomenon. His seventeen published books, innumerable articles, discourses and speeches have presented a clear and concise account of the Kundalini process, a theory for its explanation and the role it plays in the evolution of both the individual consciousness and of the race as a whole. </p><p>His experiences led him to hypothesize that there is a biological mechanism in the human body which is responsible for creativity, genius, psychic abilities, religious and mystical experiences, as well as some aberrant mental states. He asserted that this mechanism is responsible for the evolution of mankind and that it is ignorance of the working of this process which is at the root of the critical situation of the world today. </p><p>Gopi Krishna called for a full scientific investigation of his hypothesis and believed that the results of such an objective analysis would give mankind the knowledge and understanding necessary to progress in peace and harmony.</p></p><h2>Mastered by Love</h2><p>The men of the Bastion Club proved their bravery secretly fighting for their country.

Politics, people, events and objects are all covered,;Tintin, the extraordinary reporter with his immediately recognizable coif and his dog Snowy, has been a publishing phenomenon since he first appeared in 1928. Herge, Tintin&#39;s creator, based the stories on actual events in his world, reflecting the political tensions of the 1930s and postwar events. The Anschluss and the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the race to the moon, our Western fascination with the Abominable Snowman, the spying activities of Buster Crabbe, the revolutionary activities of Regis Bebray in South America, are just a few of the people, events and phenomena to crop up, inimitably satirized, in Herge&#39;s stories. He also drew on real objects: the aircraft, ships, guns, cars, clothes, buildings and so forth, that appear in his stories are scrupulously correct, and were often updated in subsequent editions.;This book explains the sources, of whatever kind, of all the stories.It also shows how Herge subtly adjusted the stories in new editions, adapting them to changing times and ideas, and downplaying their originally local, Belgian origins.</p><p>Michael Farr is a lifelong Tintin fan and probably the leading expert on all aspects of the stories.

When acclaimed memoirist and scholar Louise DeSalvo sold the house she and her husband had raised their children in and moved to a beautiful new home in Montclair, New Jersey, she was shocked to discover a rash of unexpected emotions interfering with her plans. Suddenly the old, cramped house was paradise, and the new house a barren building with none of the comforts or familiarity of ?home.? Faced with a sudden disillusionment over her dream house, DeSalvo turned, as she always has, to her favorite writers. What she found was a treasure trove of material, most of which has seldom been written about before, chronicling the tumultuous and inspiring moves of some of our most beloved literary figures. Percy Shelley, destitute and restless, moved his tired family from one home to another, only to settle in what he came to believe was a haunted house on the Gulf</p><p><p><b>Louise DeSalvo </b>is a writer, professor, lecturer, and scholar who lives in New Jersey. Her many books include the memoirs <i>Crazy in the Kitchen</i>, <i>Vertigo</i>, <i>Breathless</i>, and <i>Adultery</i>; the acclaimed biography <i>Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on her Life and Work</i>; and <i>Writing as a Way of Healing</i>. Recently, she moved.</p>From Percy Blythe Shelley's ultimately fatal moving habits to Elizabeth Bishop's endless search for a true home, author and professor DeSalvo chronicles the writer's quest for the perfect home in this memoir-slash-literary history. A noted Virginia Woolf biographer, DeSalvo devotes a hefty portion of the book to Woolf's journey from home to home, and her insight into the poet's turmoil and hope is fascinating. The most compelling parts of the book, however, are DeSalvo's own, both in the particulars and the big picture: "Most of my ancestors' moves, until my parents' and my generation... seem to have been caused by climate change... populations reaching critical levels, or by cataclysmic natural or historical events." Still, DeSalvo's story doesn't feel quite complete; she never adequately resolve her seeming inability to move with the fact of doing so. Early on, she remarks that, like many, she was "blindsided by moving's almost inevitable consequences," and by the book's end she seems not much closer to illumination. Still, her narrative is thought-provoking, and should interest lit fans struggling with a recent or impending move. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each of the artists - Kathe Kollwitz, Claude Cahun, Charlotte Salomon, Frida Kahlo, Carolee Schneemann, Hannah Wilke, Ana Mendieta, Adrian Piper, Cindy Sherman, and Orlan - used her art to overcome personal tragedy and trauma, so her work is in simultaneous and dramatic dialogue with both her social world and her personal history. &#34;In Her Own Image&#34; extends the dialogue between feminism and art history, while developing a psychoanalytic examination of women&#39;s self-representation. The author analyzes the work and life of each of these artists and shows how their art illuminates and advances the way women relate to their bodies - to beauty, sexuality, motherhood, relationships, race, aging, sickness, loss, and death. Their art reflects profound changes in woman&#39;s evolving self-awareness while it explores the transcendent possibilities of the female psyche and its creative potential for healing.

Charles de Lint succumbs to his fascination with the outsider in all of us, and writes of lonesome goth kids, newbie lesbians, strippers, Gypsies, angels of death and mercy, and even vampires and ghosts in a style that is remarkably refreshing after so much sword-and-bodice formula fantasy. <i>Moonlight and Vines</i> is a medley of fairy tales for the alternative crowd, with most of his city grrrls and boys sporting combat boots and wounded souls. De Lint crafts his stories with soft edges but indelible images: <blockquote> I can feel a foreign vibe in my apartment, a quivering in the air from Teresa having been there.... My furniture, the posters and prints on my walls, my knickknacks, all seemed subtly changed, a little stiff from the awareness of her looking at them. It takes a while for the room to settle down into its familiar habits. The fridge muttering to itself in the kitchen. The pictures in their frames letting out their stomachs and hanging slightly askew once more. </blockquote> Hardcore horror/fantasy enthusiasts might find the author's habit of imbuing each protagonist with a sense of wonder and self-discovery slightly saccharine and hackneyed after the umpteenth happy ending, but longtime de Lint fans will be delighted. <i>--Jhana Bach</i>Born in Holland in 1951, Charles de Lint grew up in Canada, with a few years off in Turkey, Lebanon, and Switzerland. <br><br>Although his first novel was 1984's <i>The Riddle of the Wren</i>, it was with<i> Moonheart</i>, published later that same year, that de Lint made his mark, and established him at the forefront of "urban fantasy," modern fantasy storytelling set on contemporary city streets. <i> Moonheart </i>was set in and around "Newford," an imaginary modern North American city, and many of de Lint's subsequent novels have been set in Newford as well, with a growing cast of characters who weave their way in and out of the stories.

This books tells the story of a struggle between father and son, both aspiring musicians. While the father fails in the musical world of Tsarist Russia, his son becomes a world famous cellist. For Gregor Piatigorsky, success meant escaping the grip of his father, surviving the murderous Russian pogroms, fleeing from the Bolshevik Revolution and twice escaping the Nazi Holocaust. It also meant falling in love with the daughter of the Baron de Rothschild, the wealthiest family in Europe. While Piatigorsky found fame and fortune as a musical artist and entertained presidents, kings and emperors, he was still a man without a country. As World War II destroyed everything he had ever known, Piatigorsky found sanctuary at Windy Cliff, an abandoned castle in Adirondack Mountains of Northern New York. In 1942, he achieved his dream of becoming an American citizen and finally stopped running.</p><p>A vibrant, exciting and triumphant story of Russian-American cellist Gregor Piatigorsky. --Cellist Terry King, AST Journal Summer 2005<br><br>Leave yourself time for this book, because once you start it, you won't want to put it down. --Norma Wanegar, Venice, Florida Symphony<br><br>The author's research draws the reader into Piatigorsky's world.

As Rachel Cohen writes in her introduction: &#39;They met in ordinary ways - a careful arrangement after long admiration, a friend&#39;s casual introduction, or because they both just happened to be standing near the drinks. They talked to each other for a few hours or for forty years, and later it seemed to them impossible that they could have missed each other.&#39; A Chance Meeting opens with a young Henry James in the studio of the great Civil War photographer Mathew Brady, and captures the boy in a moment of exquisite self-consciousness about being American. Later in the book Brady will return with Walt Whitman and with Ulysses Grant, while Henry James reappears with William Dean Howells and Sarah Orne Jewett. Cohen brilliantly reanimates such unforgettable pairings as Grant and Mark Twain; William James and W. E. B. Du Bois; Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz; Carl Van Vechten and Gertrude Stein; Hart Crane and Charlie Chaplin; Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston; Elizabeth Bishop and Marianne Moore; Richard Avedon and James Baldwin; and John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. In all, thirty figures</p><p>"I can't think of any book that would give more raw pleasure to a book-reading person than <b>A Chance Meeting</b>. Our sense of the continuum of literary community is strengthened and shaded by these stories, which are told with a strange alchemy of grace, restraint, humor and passion." <br>-<b>Dave Eggers</b><br><br>"As original and impressive a work of cultural history as I have encountered in years." -<b>Diane McWhorter</b>, Pulitzer-prize winning author of <b>Carry Me Home<br><br></b>"It can sometimes seem as if all American artists and writers are, and always have been, lone figures who go about their business without any contact with others of their kind. Rachel Cohen has written a lively and fascinating book that turns this idea on its head. Through the captivating device of what the French call 'the magic of the unlikely encounter', she traces a tradition of meeting, sharing, and encouragement among individual writers, painters, and photographers that has enriched American arts and letters in ways that could never have been foreseen. Cohen offers the reader the gift of interconnected portraits, tightly drawn and cleverly told, then stands aside and allows the stories of these encounters -- good as any fiction -- to work their magic. Compelling and delightful." <br>- Thad Carhart, author of <b>The Piano Shop on the Left Bank </b><i><br><br></i>"A wonderful, absorbing book in which information, anecdote, literary understanding and gossip take fire and are transformed into insight. Rachel Cohen's wit and learning, conjoined, are a marvel. The writing of <b>A Chance Meeting</b>, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, is at a rare level of grace. This is a book worth returning to, immensely distinguished and pleasurable."<br>- Robert Pinsky<br>"How rare to find a book that acts as both intellectual tonic and spiritual inspiration. Even rarer that it's written by a first-time author. The writing is elegant, poetic, and true. The monumentally deep reading that went into it is indeed its own kind of religion -- a temple of worship for thinking people who believe in the human artistic impulse." <br>-<b>John Burnham Schwartz</b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>A Chance Meeting</b> is a brilliant, innovative journey through American culture. It manages simultaneously to be intimate and sweeping, wide-ranging and sharply focused. Best of all, it makes its own quirky path through cultural history seem both serendipitous and inevitable. Like so many of the writers whose early successes she examines, Rachel Cohen is destined for great things.&#x201d; <br>-<b>Geoff Dyer</b><br><br>&#x201c;There are thirty-six braided essays in Rachel Cohen&#x2019;s lyrically evocative celebration of the American cultural provenance. Read one of them and you won&#x2019;t be able to keep yourself from reading the next. Read them all and you&#x2019;ll emerged transformed, transfigured: so that&#x2019;s what this whole adventure has been about &#x2014; that splendor, that anguish, this bounty. What a lavish gift there is in this book. Where does this new young writer get off being so good? And how do the rest of us get off being so lucky?&#x201d; <br>-<b>Lawrence Weschler</b>, director of the New York University Institute for the Humanities and author of <b>Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s Cabinet of Wonder</b>&#x201c;They met in ordinary ways,&#x201d; writes Rachel Cohen in her introduction, &#x201c;a careful arrangement after long admiration, a friend&#x2019;s casual introduction, or because they both just happened to be standing near the drinks. . . . They talked to each other for a few hours or for forty years, and later it seemed to them impossible that they could have missed each other.&#x201d;<br><br>Each chapter of this inventive consideration of American culture evokes an actual meeting between two historical figures. In 1854, Henry James, as a boy, goes with his father to have a daguerreotype made by Mathew Brady and is captured in a moment of self-consciousness about being American. Brady returns to photograph Walt Whitman and, later, at City Point in the midst of the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant. Meanwhile, Henry James begins a lasting friendship with William Dean Howells, and also meets Sarah Orne Jewett, who in turn is a mentor to Willa Cather. Mark Twain publishes Grant&#x2019;s memoirs; W.E.B. Du Bois and his professor William James visit the young Helen Keller; and Edward Steichen and Alfred Stieglitz argue about photography. Later, Carl Van Vechten and Gertrude Stein, who was also a student of William James&#x2019;s, attend a performance of The Rite of Spring; Hart Crane goes out on the town with Charlie Chaplin; Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston write a play together; Elizabeth Bishop takes Marianne Moore, who was photographed by both Van Vechten and Richard Avedon, to the circus; Avedon and James Baldwin collaborate on a book; John Cage and Marcel Duchamp play chess; and Norman Mailer and Robert Lowell march on the Pentagon in the anti&#x2013;Vietnam War demonstration of 1967. The accumulation of these pairings draws the reader into the mysterious process through which creativity has been sparked and passed on among iconoclastic American writers and artists.<br><br>Ultimately, Rachel Cohen reveals a long chain of friendship, rebellion, and influence stretching from the moment just before the Civil War through a century that had a profound effect on our own time. Drawing on a decade of research, <b>A Chance Meetin</b>g makes its own illuminating contribution to the tradition of which Cohen writes.</p><h2>Come the Night</h2><p>The aid of Black Lord, London&#39;s most notorious highwayman, is sought out by emerald-eyed hellion Silver St. Clair, who vows to reclaim her lost Norfolk birthright, even at the cost of her passion and her heart. Original.</p><p>First encounters between heroes and heroines should indeed be memorable, but here, Skye (East of Forever) has gone overboard with incredibly purple prose, and cliched, far-fetched names (Black Lord, Diablo, Little One, Beauty, Silver). Thankfully, the purple quickly fades into a darn good story and all is forgiven. Silver St. Clair is captured by the Black Lord, a highwayman who, as luck would have it, is really Lucien Delamere, heir to the richest title in Regency England. His midnight forays are a search for revenge against those who had captured him five years earlier and made his life a living hell. But Silver is the target of less scrupulous bandits because of a much coveted perfume called Millefleurs manufactured by the family business she and her brother recently inherited. The trouble is, the formula was lost when Silver's father was murdered. The appearance of Silver into Luc's life has muddled his cause and takes him way away from his purpose-or so he thinks. A pinch of mystery, a dash of intrigue make for a wonderfully high adventure. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Son of Man (Library of Korean Literature)</h2><p>One of the greatest living Korean writers here details the quest of a young seminary student seeking transcendence, running through many Western and East Asian theologies in the process.

In An Alphabetical Life, Werris reflects upon how she came to embrace the book culture as her singular way of being in the world. Her career began when the book business was conducted amid an atmosphere of civility and wry humor, and her memoir captures the essence of this time and the people she met along the way. The challenges she faced, in what was then a male-dominated industry, are also discussed &#x2014; particularly in 1976 when she was one of only two women repping books in the entire country. In describing the hilarious, eccentric characters that were her colleagues, lovers, and partners in crime, the essence of retail bookselling comes alive. Among the figures she profiles are Henry Robbins, editor of The World According to Garp; Alan Kahn, then of Pickwick Bookshop in Los Angeles, now President of Barnes and Noble Publishing; and many great and memorable retail bookbuyers and authors.</p><p>Wendy Werris was born in Brooklyn in 1950, but has lived primarily in Los Angeles since childhood. In 1970 she began working in the book business after being hired at the legendary Pickwick Bookshop in Hollywood. Following a stint at Rolling Stone / Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco, she began working as a publisher's sales representative&#x2014;and has been selling books ever since. She has also a professional photographer, and for the last few years has worked as a freelance author escort in and around Los Angeles.Uneven debut memoir about the author&#39;s more than 35 years in the bookselling business.Born in Brooklyn, Werris was only four when her father&#39;s career as a comedy writer (for Jackie Gleason, among others) took the family to California. She grew up loving books and planning to be an English teacher. In 1970, she took what she thought would be a part-time job at Pickwick Bookshop in L.A.; it turned into her profession. Werris writes about her experiences at each of the bookstores where she subsequently labored (all independent in those days), then tells how she segued into work as a publisher&#39;s rep. She describes the colleagues she liked and respected; she disses those she didn&#39;t. She remembers Charles Bukowski making a pass at her, and a one-night stand with Richard Brautigan. (Other than these encounters, she reveals little about her love life.) She met famous writers from Hunter S. Thompson to Michael Connelly, and she once &#34;stalked&#34; Kurt Vonnegut Jr. in the street. Werris ends the &#34;career&#34; portion of her tale by explaining her latest gig as a freelance author escort. Her first assignment was accompanying Jonathan Franzen to several locations: She thought he was hot; they shared some quality time. Another narrative strand chronicles the decline of her father&#39;s career and her mother&#39;s frequent unhappiness. Yet another details her 1981 rape by a knife-wielding assailant who was never caught. Werris makes little effort to intertwine these strands, so the memoir never coheres. And she repeatedly relies on the weariest cliches, which diminish every sentence they inhabit.Some extraordinary moments of great energy, emotion and even terror, too often recounted in very ordinary language.

Three men and two women. The child recanted, even cursed his parents in the name of our glorious Aspect-Emperor. The World has lost five souls, but the Heavens have gained one, praise be the God of Gods.</i></p><p><i>As for the text, I fear that your prohibition has come too late. It was, as you suspected, an account of the First Holy War as witnessed by the exiled Schoolman, Drusas Achamian. Verily, my hand trembles at the prospect of reproducing his vile and abhorrent claims, but as the original text has already been committed to the flames, I see no other way to satisfy your request. You are quite correct: Heresy is rarely singular in its essence or its effects. As with diseases, deviations must be studied, curatives prepared, lest they erupt in more virulent form.</i></p><p><i>For the sake of brevity, I will limit my review to those particulars that either directly or indirectly contradict Doctrine and Scripture. In this text, Drusas Achamian claims:</i></p><p><i>I) To have had sexual congress with our Holy Empress on the eve of the First Holy War&#x2019;s triumph over the heathen Fanim at Shimeh.</i></p><p><i>II) To have learned certain secrets regarding our Holy Aspect-Emperor, to whit: That He is not the incarnation of the God of Gods but rather a son of the D�nyain, a secret sect devoted to the mastery of all things, body and spirit. That He transcends us not as gods transcend men, but as adults transcend children. That His Zaudunyani interpretation of Inrithism is nothing more than a tool, a means for the manipulation of nations. That ignorance has rendered us His slaves.</i></p><p><i>(I admit to finding this most unnerving, for though I have always known that words and events, no matter how holy, always admit wicked interpretations, I have never before considered the way beliefs command our actions. For as this Achamian asks, if all men lay claim to righteousness, and they do, who is to say which man claims true? The conviction, the belief unto death, of those I send from this world now troubles me, such is the treachery of the idle intellect.)</i></p><p><i>III) That our Holy Aspect-Emperor&#x2019;s war to prevent the resurrection of the No-God is false. Granted, this is merely implied, since the text was plainly written before the Great Ordeal. But the fact that Drusus Achamian was once a Mandate Schoolman, and so cursed with dreams of the First Apocalypse, renders his suspicions extraordinary. Should not such a man hail the coming of Anas�rimbor Kellhus and his war to prevent the Second Apocalypse?</i></p><p><i>This is the sum of what I remember.</i></p><p><i>Having suffered this blasphemy, I understand the profundity of your concern. To hear that everything we have endured and cherished these past twenty years of war and revelation has been a lie is outrage enough.

A human horn.</p><p>For a moment all was quiet. Limbs arched across the imperious heights, and great trunks bullied the hollows beneath. Shorn saplings thatched the intervening spaces. A squirrel screeched warning from the gloom of interlocking branches. Starlings burst into the squinting sky.</p><p>They came, flickering across bands of sunlight and shadow.</p><p>Running with rutting fury, howling with rutting fury, through the lashing undergrowth, into the tabernacle deep. They swarmed over pitched slopes, kicking up leaves and humus. They parted about the trunks, chopping at the bark with rust-pitted blades. They sniffed the sky with slender noses. When they grimaced, their blank and beautiful faces were clenched like crumpled silk, becoming the expressions of ancient and inbred men.</p><p>Sranc. Bearing shields of lacquered human leather. Wearing corselets scaled with human fingernails and necklaces of human teeth.</p><p>The distant horn sounded again, and they paused, a vicious milling rabble. Words were barked among them. A number melted into the undergrowth, loping with the swiftness of wolves. The others jerked at their groins in anticipation. Blood. They could smell mannish blood.</p><p>Seed jetted black across the forest floor. They stamped it into the muck. They exulted in the stink of it.</p><p>The scouts returned, and at their jabbering the others shuddered and convulsed. It had been so long since they had last glutted their rapacious hunger. So long since they knelt at the altar of jerking limbs and mewling flesh. They could see the panicked faces. They could see the gushing blood, the knife-made orifices.</p><p>They ran, weeping for joy.</p><p>Cresting a low ridge, they found their prey hastening along the base of a back-broken cliff, trying to make their way to the far side of a gorge that opened as though by miracle several hundred paces away. The Sranc howled and chattered their teeth, raced in wild files down the slope, skidding across leaves, their legs kicking in long leaps. They hit the ground where it flattened, scrambling, running, burning hard in their rotten breeches, watching the soft Men turning mere paces before them, their faces as enticing as thighs, coming closer and closer, almost within the circle of wild-swinging swords&#x2014;</p><p>But the ground! The ground! Collapsing beneath them, like leaves thrown across sky!</p><p>Dozens of them were sucked shrieking into the black. The others clutched and jostled, tried to stop, only to be bumped screeching by their crazed kin. Their screams trailed as they plummeted into the concealed gorge, popped into silence one by one. Suddenly all was uncertain, all was threat. The war-party yammered in fear and frustration. None dared move. Eyes rolling, they stared in lust and apprehension ...</p><p>Men.</p><p>A hard-bitten handful, running as though by magic across the false forest floor. They lunged into the Sranc&#x2019;s midst, their heavy swords high and pitching. Shields cracked. Mouldered iron was bent and broken. Limbs and heads were thrown on arcs of glittering blood.</p><p>The Men roared and bellowed, hammered them to earth, hacked them to twitching ruin.</p><p>&#x201c;Scalper!&#x201d; the lone traveller cried out. His voice possessed the gravel of an old officer&#x2019;s bawl. It boomed through the gorge, easily audible over the white roar of water. As one, the men upriver stood and stared in his direction.</p><p><i>Just like animals</i>, he thought.</p><p>Indifferent to their gaze, he continued picking his way along the treacherous stones, sloshing through water every several steps. He passed a Sranc, white as a drowned fish, floating face down in a pool of translucent red.</p><p>The traveller glanced up to where the gorge walls pinched the sky into a wandering slot. Trees had been felled across the opening, forming the rafters for an improvised ceiling of saplings and sticks, covered over with leaves. The sky glared bright through numerous holes. Leaves still twittered down in a steady cascade. If the numbers of inert forms scattered and heaped about the rocks were any indication, it had been a very effective trap. In places, the river&#x2019;s foam spouted pink and violet.</p><p>Most of the men had returned to their work, but three continued to watch him warily. He had no doubt that the one he sought was among them.</p><p>The traveller tramped into their midst. The smell of burst entrails soured that of water and scoured stone. Most of the party sorted through the dead Sranc. Bodies were kicked off bodies. Broken heads were pulled from the water. Knives flashed. It was the same each time: pinch, saw, swipe, then on to the next one. Pinch, saw, swipe&#x2014;again and again. A flap of skin cut from the crown of every one.</p><p>Nearby, a young Galeoth swordsman washed a small hoard of scalps. He rinsed them, then laid them out, glistening and fatty white across dry stone. He handled each swatch with ludicrous care, the way a halfwit might handle gold&#x2014;which scalps had pretty much become in the High Middle-North. Though the Aspect-Emperor had lowered the Hallow Bounty, a scalp still fetched a full silver kellic from honest brokers.</p><p>They were all extremely conscious of his arrival, the traveller knew. They simply pretended to be indifferent. Usually, they encountered outsiders only when they trekked south to the brokers, flush with hundreds of tanned scalps, bound and dangling from lengths of leather string. This work, the work of collecting and counting, was the least manly portion of their trade. It was their menial secret.</p><p>It was also the point.</p><p>Nearly eleven years had passed since the Aspect-Emperor had declared his bounty on Sranc scalps, before the last of the Unification Wars had ended. He placed the bounty on Sranc because of their vast numbers. He placed the bounty on scalps because their hairlessness made them distinctive to Sranc. Men such as these, the traveller supposed, would be far happier poaching something less inclined to kill back&#x2014;like women and children.</p><p>So began the Scalping Years. Over that time, countless thousands had trudged into the northern wilderness, expedition after expedition, come to make their fortune as Scalpoi. Most died in a matter of weeks. But those who learned, who were wily and every bit as ruthless as their foe, prospered.</p><p>And some&#x2014;a few&#x2014;became legendary.</p><p>The man the traveller sought stood upon a rounded stone, watching the others work. He knew him from his dogged devotion to the traditional costume of his caste and race: the pleated war-skirt, stained grey and black and shot through with holes; the corselet with rusty scales stitched into rotting leather; the conical helm, bent back like a single ram&#x2019;s horn. He looked a wraith from another age. A second man, his face concealed by a black cowl, sat three paces behind him, leaning forward as though straining to hear something in the water&#x2019;s ambient rush. The traveller peered at him for a moment, as though trying to judge some peculiarity, then returned his gaze to the first man.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking for the Ainoni,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The one they call Ironsoul.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be me,&#x201d; the standing man replied. His face had been tattooed with the cosmetics favoured by his countrymen. Black lines about his eyes. Purpled lips. His look neither accused nor questioned but remained mild in the manner of bored assassins. Incurious.</p><p>&#x201c;Veteran,&#x201d; the traveller said, bowing his head in due respect. Failing to properly acknowledge and venerate a survivor of the First Holy War was no small offence.</p><p>&#x201c;How did you find us?&#x201d; the man asked in his native tongue. From the cadence of his voice, it was obvious that he despised speaking, that he was as jealous of his voice as he was of his women or his blood.</p><p>The traveller did not care. Men prized what they would.</p><p>&#x201c;We find everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>A barely perceptible nod. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You, Scalper. We want you.&#x201d;</p><p>The Ainoni glanced back toward his cowled companion. No words were exchanged, only an inscrutable look.</p><p><i><b>Late Autumn, 19 New Imperial Year (4131 Year-of-the-Tusk), Momemn</b></i></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Ever do Men seek to hide what is base and mean in their natures.

He began writing his first fantasy novel in college. It was a book he later trunked, but it was a start, a thing that proved how much he enjoyed the creation of stories. It made him want to write more.&nbsp;He went on to write The Lays of Anuskaya series as well as The Song of Shattered Sands series.

She felt the anger roil�ing inside her like a pot boiling over. He&#x2019;d probably come straight here to brag to his friends, show them what he&#x2019;d done and challenge them to do the same, then demand tribute like some paltry lord of mud and fleas. <br> &nbsp;<br> The lot of them were playing skipjack along the Haddah&#x2019;s muddy banks. One by one, boys and girls would run to the lip of the bank and leap onto a grimy piece of canvas pulled taut as a drum by seven or eight of the older children, who would then launch the little ones into the air. They would flail their arms and legs mid- flight, screaming or yelling, before splashing like stones into the Haddah, water spraying like diamonds in the dry, desert heat. <br> &nbsp;<br> Lip curling, �eda watched as Brama was launched in turn. He barked like a jackal and flew through the air to crash into the water, arms and legs spread wide. After, he waded back to the canvas and relieved one of the others so they could make a run of their own&#x2014; he same pattern he&#x2019;d followed every other time he&#x2019;d jumped into the river. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>When he reaches dry ground, </i>�eda told herself. <br> &nbsp;<br> With a measured pace, �eda pulled out a locket on a silver chain from inside her dress. She pried the locket open, its two halves spreading like wings to reveal a dried white petal with a tip of palest blue. After taking the petal out, she clipped the locket closed and placed the fragile petal beneath her tongue. Spit filled her mouth. A shiver ran down her frame as the flavor of spices filled her. Mace and rosemary and a hint of jasmine and other things she didn&#x2019;t have words for. <br> &nbsp;<br> The petal had been stolen from the adichara, a forbid�den tree that bloomed only once every six weeks under the light of the twin moons. When gathered on such nights, they were imbued with breathtaking power. Part of her hated to use even one of the petals on Brama, but her anger over what he&#x2019;d done was more than strong enough to smother any reluctance. <br> &nbsp;<br> As the effects of the petal spread, granting a barely contained verve to her limbs, she stuffed the locket back inside her dress and scanned the river. Colors were sharper now. She could <i>hear </i>more as well, not only the children in the river but the very breath and rattle of the city. It took effort in the early moments of imbibing the petals to concentrate, but she was used to doing so, and she focused her attention on those near and around Brama. A clutch of children were playing downriver, some trying to spear fish, others wading and laughing or splashing one another. Most likely they wouldn&#x2019;t inter�fere. There was one who gave her pause, though, a dark- skinned Kundhunese boy with bright blue eyes. He stood apart from the others, and seemed to be watching Brama and the children with almost as much interest as �eda. She would swear she&#x2019;d seen him before, but just then she couldn&#x2019;t remember where or when it might have been. <br> &nbsp;<br> She worked at the memory, scratching at it, but like chasing a stubborn sliver it only sank deeper in her mind, and soon Brama was handing over his section of the can�vas to a girl with a lopsided grin. <br> &nbsp;<br> The moment Brama gained the bank, �eda parted the cattails and marched forward. &#x201c;Brama!&#x201d; <br> He turned, staring at her with a frown. Her identity was still hidden by her white turban and veil, so he wouldn&#x2019;t know who she was, but she could see in his eyes that he recognized the flowing blue dress she&#x2019;d been wear�ing early that morning. <br> &nbsp;<br> He scanned the area to see if anyone else was with her. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something you stole from me,&#x201d; she called, &#x201c;and I mean to have it back.&#x201d; �eda didn&#x2019;t know Brama well. He was a boy who liked to traipse about Sharakhai&#x2019;s west end, bullying some, shying away from others. He was an opportunist and a right good lock- lip if rumor was true. She might have gone all her days and never thought twice about Brama but that morning he&#x2019;d stolen something from her: a purse she was meant to deliver to Osman&#x2014;a shade, as it was known in Sharakhai. It was as simple a task as Osman had ever given her&#x2014;hardly more than a prance across the city&#x2014;and she&#x2019;d bungled it, but she&#x2019;d be damned by Bakhi&#x2019;s bright hammer before she&#x2019;d let a boy like Brama get away with it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Brama&#x2019;s eyes flicked to the children in the river. They were watching, not yet approaching, but it wouldn&#x2019;t take long before they came to back him up. The moment his eyes were off her, �eda drew her shinai, her curved wooden practice sword, from its holder at her belt. She didn&#x2019;t like walking around Sharakhai with a real sword&#x2014;girls of fif�teen, even tall as she was, attracted notice when bearing steel&#x2014;but few enough spent more than a passing glance at a girl wearing a shinai, especially in the west end where children practicing the dance of blades could be found on any street, alley, or open space one cared to look.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brama&#x2019;s eyes were only for �eda now. He looked her up and down, perhaps truly noticing her frame for the first time. She was tall. She had more muscle than he might have noticed earlier. She was holding a sword with a cozy grip&#x2014; <i>lover&#x2019;s </i>grip, the bladewrights called it, the kind that revealed just how intimate a sword and its mas�ter were with one another&#x2014; nd with the magic of the petal now running through her veins, �eda was itching to use it. <br> &nbsp;<br> Brama&#x2019;s friends were stepping out of the water now, and it seemed to lend him some confidence, for he swelled, not unlike a man who&#x2019;d had one too many glasses of araq, or like the dirt dogs in the pits often did when they knew they were outmatched. He stuffed one hand down his still- ripping trousers and pulled out a short but well-edged knife. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got nothing of yours&#x201d;&#x2014;he smiled as the other children fanned around and behind �eda&#x2014;&#x201c;so why don&#x2019;t you run off before that pretty dress of yours is stained red?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Brama had muscle as well, but it was the rangy sort, the kind that felt good to thump with the edge of a wooden sword. &#x201c;You stole a purse, cut from my belt as I strode through the spice market.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A thousand and one gutter wrens wander that mar�ket day and night. Any one of them might have stolen your purse.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ah, but it <i>wasn&#x2019;t </i>any one of them.&#x201d; She lifted the point of her shinai and thrust it toward Brama&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;The nick from your little knife wasn&#x2019;t nearly as clean as you thought, Brama Junayd&#x2019;ava. I saw you running like a whipped dog down the aisles, and I <i>know </i>you heard me calling.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> She thought he might be put off by the use of his fa�milial name, but instead he squinted, as if he recognized her voice and was trying to place it. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know who it might have been, but you&#x2019;re a fool if you think it was me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The circle around her was closing in now, some with river stones clutched in their scrawny hands. <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda took a half-step closer to Brama and dropped into a fighting stance. &#x201c;This is your last warning, Brama.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Brama merely smiled. &#x201c;You should have run while you had the chance.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> �eda didn&#x2019;t wait any longer. She charged. <br> &nbsp;<br> She brought her sword swiftly down against his hast�ily raised defenses. The wooden blade beat with an audi�ble crack against his forearms, then his rib cage, then his knee&#x2014; ot enough to break bones, though she could eas�ily have done so, but certainly enough to send him crum�pling to the ground. <br> &nbsp;<br> Other children rushed in, but if her time in the pits had taught her anything it was how to maintain distance with the enemy, even many at once. She rushed past Bra�ma&#x2019;s fallen form, twisting and striking a girl every bit as tall as Brama across the face. Another came barreling after, but �eda dropped and snapped her leg out, catch�ing the girl and sending her tumbling off the bank and into the river. <br> &nbsp;<br> The ones with the stones loosed them at �eda as two more boys braved the range of her sword. One stone struck a glancing blow against her shoulder, another squarely against her ribs, but the effects of the petal dead�ened the pain. Four quick strokes of her shinai and the boys were howling away, shaking pain from their knuck�les and wrists. <br> &nbsp;<br> She was alone now. None would come near. Even the boy holding rocks the size of lemons remained still as a statue, the fear plain on his face. <br> &nbsp;<br> Brama lay at her feet, cringing. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the purse?&#x201d; she asked him. <br> &nbsp;<br> His face grew hard, his teeth gritting away the pain. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have it.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t what I asked you, Brama.&#x201d; She grabbed a hunk of his hair&#x2014;&#x201c;I said, <i>where is it?</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;and slammed his head onto the ground. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have it!&#x201d; </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow, his refusal made her go calm as the night&#x2019;s cool winds. She let go of Brama&#x2019;s hair and stood, staring down at him with her shinai still held easily in her right hand. &#x201c;When are you going to learn, Brama?&#x201d; She raised her sword, ready to give him something to think about before asking him the question again, but she stopped when she heard a piercing whistle from somewhere along the riverbank. She turned, but not before laying the tip of her sword over Brama&#x2019;s kidney, a warning for him to lie still. <br> &nbsp;<br> A man with broad shoulders wearing laced sandals and a striped kaftan was standing near the edge of the river, staring at her. The sun glinted brightly off the lat�tice of shallow waves behind him, so she didn&#x2019;t at first recognize him&#x2014;and why by the gods&#x2019; sweet breath would he be here in any case?&#x2014;but soon she <i>did </i>recognize him. <br> &nbsp;<br> Osman. <br> &nbsp;<br> The very man she should have delivered the purse to this morning.</p><h2>The Well: David&#39;s Story</h2><p>In Mississippi in the early 1900s ten-year-old David Logan&#39;s family generously shares their well water with both white and black neighbors in an atmosphere of potential racial violence.</p><p>Mildred D.

"Charlie Simms was always mean, and that's the truth of it." From the first line, this short, intense novel of racist violence is told with the immediacy of a family narrative. David Logan (the father in Taylor's 1977 Newbery Award winner, <i>Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry</i>) tells a story of his boyhood in rural Mississippi at a time when "uppity niggers" can be hanged for thinking themselves equal to whites and the horror of slavery still haunts his mother's memory. The Logans are among the few black families to own land, and during a prolonged drought, they have a well of sweet water, which they share with their neighbors, black and white. Most people are grateful, but the white Simms family hates being beholden to blacks. The tense confrontation erupts in beatings and terror. The cast is large for so short a novel--it's hard sometimes to keep track of all the people in the community--but the Logan family is beautifully individualized. David is able to heed his father's warning, "Use your head, not your fists," but David's hotheaded older brother can't bear the constant humiliation. The well of the title is also a metaphor for the history of the place: both the bigotry that lies beneath the surface and the sweet strength of family ties. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Larkin&#39;s Dulcimer Book</h2><p>Larkin Wall Bryant had begun a career as a professional artist when she met the mountain dulcimer, and has since devoted her art to the music of this down-to-earth yet ethereal instrument.

Combining historical data on the regulation of midwifery in Europe and the Unites States with a field study of the regulation of midwifery in Texas, Arizona, and California, Raymond G. DeVries uncovers the subtle ways legislation alters the profession-demonstrating both beneficial and detrimental consequences. This new edition includes an updated preface that situates the themes of the book in the current debate over health care and midwifery, an epilogue that examines the major issues in the 1990s and comments on developments that have taken place over the past decade, and an update bibliography.

Framed by chapters which outline the way the Middle Ages began and ended, and the book consists of six other sections covering religion and the Church, nations and laws, daily life, art and architecture, scholarship and philosophy, and the World beyond Christendom. The glories of medieval painting, glass, manuscripts and architecture are examined, as well as the more intimate and darker side of life: home, shops, the family, work, war, disease and death. The book has a cross-referencing system and includes a 30-page illustrated biographical dictionary including family trees.</p><p>Robert Bartlett is Wardlaw Professor of Medieval History at the University of St Andrews. His publications include The Making of Europe and Trial by Fire and Water: The Medieval Judicial Ordeal.<p>More than just a range of years, the Middle Ages are distinguished by the society, lifestyle, perceptions, and beliefs of that time. The author of several books on medieval society and history, Bartlett (medieval history, Univ. of St. Andrews, Scotland) introduces the Middle Ages through eight major themes, which are then illustrated by selections of medieval art. The arrangement is intriguing and thematic, covering everything from religion, knighthood, and courtly love to alchemy, daily labor, and ceremony. Within each of the broader chapters are subtopics illustrated with medieval art depicting the topic as interpreted by the people of the time. These sections are cross-referenced to other related topics by color-coded notations on the bottom of the pages. Many features make this book particularly useful to students a 35-page biographical dictionary, time lines, maps, a glossary, a bibliography, and a list of 22 web sites devoted to medieval studies. For better encyclopedic coverage of the period, public and school libraries should have The Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages (Viking, 1999), but Medieval Panorama makes a fine companion and is recommended for all library collections.

Jamie finds that on Altair he still has his arm and can speak. The planet is technologically stuck in 1607 due to a scarcity of natural resources, so Jamie and Ramsay use their knowledge of chemistry to show the citizens how to make "Greek Fire" (sulfur, quicklime, and petroleum) to burn their enemies' iceships.

My hands were grasping my shins and my eyes were filled with tears.<br><br> I looked up and found myself directly in his shadow. His full beard and round belly absorbed the rare rays of light that penetrated the canopy above us. His presence was unmovable, overbearing yet completely mute.<br><br> Why doesn't he say anything?! I thought. Why won't he try to motivate me or at least place his hand on my shoulder to comfort me? I wouldn't be out here if it weren't for him.<br><br> I'd already hiked the entire Appalachian Trail(AT) twice. But this time it was different. This time, I was trying to become the fastest person&#x2014;male or female&#x2014;to travel the 2,189-mile footpath. I was aiming for a fastest known time.<br><br> It was day seven and I had already traversed almost three hundred miles of the unforgiving yet alluring terrain. Maine&#x2014;that dark, full-bodied beauty&#x2014;had taken more than her fair share out of me. Now, just a few miles into New Hampshire, I was exhausted, filthy, and crippled by shin splints. I longed for a quick, dignified end to the shooting pains, the relentless discomfort.<br><br> My current audience wasn't hiking with me. Instead, he had come in by a side trail to check on my progress. I couldn't decide whether I was grateful or angry to see him. I vacillated between crediting him with my progress and blaming him for my near demise. At least his presence gave me a reason to catch my breath.<br><br> Through heavy breathing and repressed sobs, I asked him, "How do you know when to quit?"<br><br> There was a drawn-out silence. Just when I'd convinced myself he wasn't going to respond, Warren said, "There's a difference between quitting and stopping."<br><br> I looked up at his backlit silhouette, then I returned my gaze to the ground. Next to his thrift-store sneakers, he had displayed a selection of vending machine junk food and neon-colored sodas. None of it appealed to me.<br><br> Finally, I let out a deep breath filled with congestion and unreleased emotion, picked up a purple vial of synthetic energy elixir&#x2014;the kind of unregulated ooze they hawk at gas stations&#x2014;then continued hobbling down the trail. Because we knew that if I stopped, I would be quitting.<br><br> I was a week into my record attempt on the Appalachian Trail, and with just one-seventh of the trail behind me I'd already wrestled with the greatest hurt that I had ever felt. The pain from the shin splints was sharp, stabbing, and hot, but the ache of covering nearly fifty miles a day was widespread, dull, and throbbing. It was an all-encompassing agony. I doubted I could make it to the end of the day, let alone the end of the trail. But with Warren by my side, I felt pressure-mostly positive pressure-to keep going. We were two people who shared the same questions.<br><br> What was my capacity for endurance? Was it good enough to set a fastest known time? And could I outperform all the men who had come before me?<br><br> Because I could still drag one foot in front of the other, I knew that I had not yet found those answers. Warren's watchful eye held me accountable to this very personal and painful scientific query.<br> A week earlier, I had set off from the summit of Katahdin with a spring in my step. I descended just over five miles on a steep, boulder-strewn path to meet Warren and my husband, Brew, at the base of the mountain. Lots of folks wished me well, or said they believed in me, but these were the only two men willing to drive to the heart of Maine, a place filled with blackflies and bogs, to begin this experiment by my side.<br><br> With each road crossing Warren and Brew marked my progress.<br><br> "You made it here this fast," said Brew.<br><br> "You are this far behind the record," said Warren.<br><br> "You have this far to the next road," said Brew.<br><br> "You should leave now to get there," said Warren.<br> After hiking 150 miles in three days, our team arrived at the banks of the Kennebec River. Trying to use every minute, I decided to ford the river. Alternatively, I would need to wait one hour to take advantage of a canoe ferry. Steered by a seasonal employee of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the canoe ferries afford hikers a safe, mostly dry, transport across the dam-controlled artery.<br><br> Warren had crossed the river numerous times on foot, so I followed his sturdy calves into the water. His strong legs moved sideways against the forceful current until they disappeared. Then his waist waded past the white ripples on the surface of the water. Soon he was immersed up to his armpits in the cold, flowing channel.<br><br> I kept my eyes on Warren and struggled to keep my toes anchored to the large, smooth stones at my feet. Breathless from fear and the chill of the water, I tried to stay in his wake. My sports bra changed from a light purple to a dark violet as I forged deeper and farther into the river. I listened to Warren as he voiced a steady and concise refrain. "Feet down. Feet down. Feet down." I repeated the chorus in a murmuring echo, hoping to drown out the profanities swimming through my head.<br><br> I noticed goose bumps on my skin as my stomach muscles rose above the surface of the water. Soon my thighs slashed through the dark grips of the Kennebec, and after a harrowing and invigorating twenty-minute crossing, I stood dripping wet on the opposite shore. My eyes turned to meet Warren's approving gaze. I smiled and let out a half whimper, half giggle. Warren responded with a deep, bellowing laugh. Then he struck a pose and shouted, "I may have the face of a sixty-one-year-old and the belly of a couch potato, but I've still got the legs of a WILD RIVER MAN!"<br><br> Here stood my ferryman: the person who had taught me the difference between stopping and quitting, the man who believed that I could be the first woman to set the overall record on the Appalachian Trail, and the individual who showed me how to keep my feet down and not get swept away by the current.<br> The year 1973 marked the beginning of the end of the Vietnam War. It was the year of the controversial Roe v. Wade verdict in the Supreme Court. The Watergate scandal infiltrated the ranks of the White House.<br><br> Warren Doyle was twenty-three years old.<br><br> He was aware of the civil unrest and he was becoming a proponent of social justice. As a child, he had witnessed his father, a veteran of World War II, struggle to find work and support his family. As an undergrad, Warren spent a summer volunteering in the mountains of Jamaica. Most of the locals there lived in corrugated metal shacks. When his mother came to visit, he refused to stay in the hotel with her. The disparity between the wealth of the tourists and poverty of the natives was so unsettling to Warren that he preferred to spend the night with the homeless street kids rather than sleep on clean white sheets.<br><br> The summer after his senior year, he volunteered at a folk school on the edge of the West Virginia coalfields, where he saw the same type of injustice and economic disparity that he had witnessed in Jamaica. Here he met the Appalachian poet and activist Don West, who quickly became an inspiration and mentor.<br><br> Warren was the first member of his family to attend college. After receiving his undergraduate degree in elementary education, he accepted a University of Connecticut fellowship that aimed to help schoolteachers understand and implement desegregation through a prestigious doctoral program. He was learning about society and he was learning about education, but he still didn't know who he was.<br><br> "I still had questions," he said. "Was I a product of society or was I an individual? I wanted to do something that didn't have an extrinsic reward. I wanted an ultimate challenge&#x2014;a cleansing."<br><br> It isn't uncommon for a young adult to question his identity and the culture in which he lives. But Warren was unlike many of his contemporaries who were drawn to drug-infused music festivals and social protests. As the youngest grad school student in his program, he was an achiever, and he tried to respond to injustice and uncertainty by excelling in his academic field.<br><br> After reading of the walkabouts and pilgrimages so important in other cultures, Warren decided that he would hike the Appalachian Trail. But because he didn't like to waste time or money and because he wanted to know how much he could take-and how much he could give-Warren decided to complete the trail in under seventy days.<br> Warren wasn't always driven. In fact, in middle school, he was a mediocre student; social survival trumped academic achievement. "I was scared to raise my hand in class. I didn't want to stand out. I was afraid if I knew the answers, I would get beat up."<br><br> Then one day his fifteen-year-old sister, Colleen, his only sibling, developed a bad headache. Three days later, she died from an undetected brain aneurysm.<br><br> "I remember my parents' grief more than my own," said Warren. "I can still see the look on their faces as they came up the stairs to tell me the news. Their expressions were full of suffering. And now they had to put that aside and find a way to try and comfort me, their son, the only child they had left."<br><br> When a person is affected deeply by the passing of another, he can choose to die, too. He can turn to self-destructive habits and let his emotions become shriveled and cynical. On the other hand, a grief that deep can also awaken something in a person and motivate him to live life more fully.<br><br> "I never wanted to see my parents hurt that much again," said Warren. "I vowed that I would make my life count double."<br> In May of 1973, Warren's parents drove him south from Connecticut to Springer Mountain, Georgia. Recent heavy rainfall in the Southern Appalachians had caused rivers to flood and roads to wash out. When they stopped on their route to drop a resupply package off at the newly built Nantahala Outdoor Center, the coursing waters of the Nantahala River lapped at the wooden buildings on its banks. In a week's time, Warren would need to pick up his cardboard box filled with several days' worth of rations and replacement gear in order to continue his journey. He left his box of foodstuffs at the outfitter, hoping that his provisions and the building would be there when he arrived.<br><br> In north Georgia, the forest service road leading up to the trail's southern terminus was in such poor shape that Warren insisted his parents turn back. Without knowing exactly where he was or how far he had to walk to reach the trailhead, Warren buckled his pack over his blue jeans, slung a two-quart metal canteen over his shoulder, and started hiking.<br><br> When Warren reached the top of Springer Mountain, his first thought was for his parents' safety. He doubted their ability to drive down the gravel road without incident. He envisioned the soft shoulder giving way, his parents' car sliding off the side of the mountain.<br><br> The first three miles of his hike passed quickly as Warren worried about his folks. But when he arrived at the Three Forks stream crossing, he started to worry about his own predicament.<br><br> The mountain stream was swollen and the bridge had been washed away. Warren knew he would have to ford the stream, but he didn't want to get his new leather boots wet. When he unlaced his left boot and heaved it into the air, it barely cleared the opposite bank. He then removed his right shoe and threw it with even more oomph, but the added strength caused the boot to hit a low-hanging hemlock branch and drop straight down into the water. The current swiftly carried it downstream.<br><br> In a panic, Warren threw off his pack and plunged in, body surfing around boulders and fallen branches until he was able to reach out and grab the nearly submerged boot. With his free hand, he pulled himself up on the bank. Once on terra firma, he dumped the water from his boot and laced it up below his sopping wet blue jeans. After navigating a maze of rhododendron branches upstream, he finally buckled his dry pack onto his dripping body and plodded half shod through the raging waters of the Three Forks to where the other boot was waiting. Warren had exited the mainstream. He put on his shoe and kept walking.<br><br> On the second day of his journey, Warren summited Blood Mountain before descending to Highway 19 at Neel Gap, where there was a small roadside store and hiker hostel. He took his boots off, hoping against hope that they would eventually dry out, then he used the pay phone to confirm that his parents were safe.<br><br> Less than a week later, Warren found his resupply package right where he'd left it at the Nantahala Outdoor Center. Then he worked his way through Great Smoky Mountains National Park and over the Southern Appalachian high points, Unaka Mountain, Roan Mountain, and Mount Rogers.<br><br> Three and a half weeks into his hike, Warren made it to Pearisburg, Virginia. He'd come more than 625 miles. To celebrate his progress, he went straight to the town's Dairy Queen, where he consumed french fries, a cheeseburger, and ice cream. He felt a little queasy, but he ordered a few more menu items for good measure, placing them in his pack before walking back to the trail, where he set up camp.<br><br> The next morning Warren woke up, broke camp, and polished off the carton of orange juice, jug of milk, and other treats he'd been saving for breakfast. Hiking out of Pearisburg on Route 460, he started to cross the bridge that spans the New River.<br><br> He only made it halfway. He was suspended sixty feet above one of the oldest rivers in the world when his stomach churned and started cramping. He thought about turning back, but it was too late. Maybe he could make it across if he took his time. He took a step. Then he froze. He clenched every muscle in his body, but it didn't matter. There was nothing he could do. Almost a third of the way into his record attempt on the Appalachian Trail, Warren Doyle stood on the shoulder of a bridge in Pearisburg, Virginia, shitting himself.<br>Warren waddled back to town feeling physically depleted and emotionally ruined. He stopped at the first motel he came to and asked about a room and a shower. When the desk attendant saw him, she immediately called an ambulance. At the hospital, Warren receivedan IV, and once he started to feel better he called home with an update. When his father heard that Warren was in the hospital, he got in the car and drove south.<br><br>Warren Doyle, Sr., a toll collector on the Connecticut Turnpike, made arrangements to take as much time off as possible so he could support his son on the trail. As a parent who&#x2019;d struggled financially and couldn&#x2019;t put his child through college, this was a very physical way for a father to help his son. With his father&#x2019;s support, Warren got back on the trail and began to make up time and miles. And with his father carrying the majority of his provisions in a station wagon and meeting him at road crossings, Warren could travel farther and more efficiently than before.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t take long, however, for Warren Sr. to learn just how difficultit is to offer support on a long-distance hike&#x2014;especially to someone you love. Not only was he responsible for having the proper gear and food at hand, but he also had to navigate the unmarked forest roads of rural Appalachia with handheld maps. Even more difficultwas the emotional toll of supporting his son.<br><br>When Warren hit the mid-Atlantic, the summer temperatures soared and his dad had to watch him suffer through oppressive heat.The triple-digit temperatures and suffocating humidity made it hard to...</p><h2>The Paths of the Dead</h2><p>The long-awaited sequel to<i> The Phoenix Guards </i>and <i>Five Hundred Years After</i><br><br>Two hundred years after Adron&#x2019;s Disaster, in which Dragaera City was accidentally reduced to an ocean of chaos by an experiment in wizardry gone wrong, the Empire isn&#x2019;t what it used to be.

Yet they definitely were real-as this first comprehensive, worldwide historical survey makes abundantly clear-and considerably more frightening historically than Long John Silver or Captain Hook. The barnacled sea dogs featured in this fascinating volume well deserved their reputations for bravery, hard drinking, avarica, foul language-and casual violence and cruelty.</p><p>This worldwide overview of piracy discusses incidents from the earliest days of sea travel to modern times. Julius Caesar was among a group held for ransom by pirates in 78 B.C., and in the Philippines from 1983 to 1994, attacks by pirates armed with automatic rifles averaged nine per month. Accompanying the text are photographs of weapons used, maps of major harbors, and paintings of famous pirates and their ships. Large-scale, detailed drawings of pirate ships include Captain Kidd's vessel from 1695. Although young men generally sought fortune and fame as pirates, a few women also made this choice. Two of the most notorious were Mary Read and Anne Bonny, captured together in 1720 off the coast of Jamaica. They were jailed but not hung (common punishment for Western pirates), because both proved to be pregnant. This book's 11 chapters by notable maritime historians contain 300 full-color illustrations and a lengthy bibliography, all of which supplement the six-part TBS documentary, <i>Pirate Tales</i>, to be broadcast in February. <i>Jennifer Henderson</i>YA. A comprehensive study of piracy from the 1600s to the 1900s. Each chapter is written by a different expert and covers one aspect of the topic, including piracy in the Caribbean, the Mediterranean and, unlike most books on the subject, the pirates of the Far East. A chapter also is devoted to modern pirates and the steps the international community is taking to eliminate them. The book contains many pictures of artifacts, 16th- and 17th-century illustrations, color paintings by noted artists Howard Pyle and Frank Schoonover, and period photographs of pirates and anti-piracy operations from the past 140 years. The text is well written and easy to follow. An ideal companion to Cordingly's Under the Black Flag (Random, 1996).?Robert Burnham, R. E.

The great apostle&#x2019;s life, intellect, and unconquerable spirit come alive as never before in this insightful look at Paul&#x2019;s individual letters to Timothy and Titus.&nbsp;Here you will find Paul sharing intimately and personally, yet these letters contain some of the most profound theological insights found in Scripture. In these letters, Paul flings back the curtain of time and space to reveal the unseen realities of God&#x2019;s eternal plan for the human race.&nbsp;As you explore the truths of these three pastoral letters of Paul, you&#x2019;ll discover new depths of appreciation for God&#x2019;s Word&#x2014;and new encouragement and inspiration for your daily walk with Christ.<p>Ray C. Stedman&nbsp;(1917&#x2013;1992) was one of the great pastors, expositors, and spiritual leaders of the twentieth century. A graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, he was pastor of Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto, California, for forty years. Stedman wrote over twenty books with a million copies in distribution. His book&nbsp;<i>Body Life</i>&nbsp;had a tremendous impact on the church in the twentieth century.</p></p><h2>Brugmansia and Datura: Angel&#39;s Trumpets and Thorn Apples</h2><p><p> Stately Angel's Trumpets -- Brugmansia -- are spectacular plants, growing like small trees and living for several years. Datura, sometimes called Thorn Apples, are mostly annuals and are cultivated like summer flowers. The impressive bell flowers of both varieties -- in white, yellow, pink and red -- are extraordinarily decorative. It's no surprise that Brugmansia and Datura are prized by enthusiasts around the world. </p><p> This comprehensive guide for North American gardeners features: </p><ul> <li></li>history and folklore of Brugmansia and Datura <li></li>the latest information on how to distinguish and classify Brugmansia and Datura <li></li>form and shape of the flowers and plants -<li></li>covering all aspects of species, hybrids and varities <li></li>hybrid Angel's Trumpets and wild species of Thorn Apples <li></li>building a Brugmansia collection <li></li>care and cultivation <li></li>over-wintering, propagation and breeding <li></li>diseases and pests <li></li>index, bibliography and nursery sources <li></li>over 110 beautiful color photographs and numerous illustrations. </ul><p></p></p><p><p> <b>Ulrike</b> and <b>Hans-Georg Preissel</b> have been involved in breeding Brugmansia and Datura for many years, and have a large collection of these fascinating plants. Both authors have studied horticulture in Hanover, Germany, and, since 1984, Hans-Georg Preissel has been the head of the 17th-century Herrenh�user Gardens, where most of the plants featured in this book were photographed. </p><p><b> Preface </b></p> <p> With the publication of the German edition of this book, we hoped as many gardeners as possible would become enthusiastic about growing <i>Brugmansia</i>. Happily our wish seems to have been fulfilled. And thanks are due to those plant growers who are successfully breeding this plant as a hobby. They have bestowed on us an ever more colorful and varied range of hybrids. </p><p> This has meant that the current varieties in this book have had to be revised. We have added a description of the numerous hybrids that <i>Brugmansia aurea</i>, <i>B. suaveolens</i> and <i>B. versicolor</i> have helped to develop. With the help of the publishers, we were also able to include the genus <i>Datura</i> within this edition. As a result, and because of the wealth of pictures, the book has not only considerably increased in scope but has also been enriched in content. </p><p> By presenting the old genus <i>Datura</i> and the more recent genus <i>Brugmansia</i> together, we expect to gain more acceptance for the genus name <i>Brugmansia</i>. According to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature this has been a valid genus name since 1970, but in Germany and other European countries the genus <i>Brugmansia</i> (Angel's Trumpets) and <i>Datura</i> are often still not classified separately. </p><p> Unfortunately, the increase in the popularity of Angel's Trumpets has seen an increase in new diseases affecting the plants, some of which cannot yet be identified. The descriptions of both the diseases and their symptoms also had to be expanded. We hope that in the future those institutions that deal with plant diseases will give more attention to <i>Brugmansia</i> so that diagnosis and cures can be described in more detail. </p><p> In the chapter "Natural Changes in Angel's Trumpets" we mention some interesting features that make these plants so fascinating to observe. </p><p> We were able to gain totally new knowledge on <i>Brugmansia vulcanicola</i>. This was thanks to the help of Prof. Richard E. Schultes (Botanical Museum of Harvard University, Cambridge) and Prof. Alvaro Fernandez-Perez (Universitaria De Popayan, Colombia) who were able to obtain for us the rare seeds from their natural habitat. We would like to thank both them and the other botanists, gardeners and friends, Clarence Kl. Horich, Dr. Adolfo Holguin, Hans-Erhard Wichert, and Prof. Dr. Karl Zimmer, to mention just a few of the many who helped us in so many ways with the German edition. </p><p> Hannover, 2002<br> Ulrike and Hans-Georg Preissel</p></p>
